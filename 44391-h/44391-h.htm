<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In preparing these volumes, it has been my aim
to give a clear and fairly complete account of the
arts and crafts of older Spain. It seems to me
that there is room for a work of this design and
scope, and that there is no reason why so attractive
a subject&mdash;or rather, group of subjects&mdash;should
be perpetually ignored by persons who travel
through, or who profess to feel an interest in,
the country of the Cid and of Don Quixote.</p>

<p>My account of Spanish pottery is guarded, and
yet I trust acceptable. The study of this craft in
Spain is far from definite, and fresh researches
and discoveries may be hoped for at some future
time. The history of Spanish arms has also
suffered from unjust neglect. Perhaps my sketch
of them may slightly compensate for this deficiency.
For the rest, my book, which represents
the well-meant assiduity of several years, shall
speak for itself.</p>

<p>Although I was embarrassed by too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
material, the illustrations have been chosen with
great care, and not, I think, inadequately. Some
of the photographs were taken specially for this
work. For the loan of others, or for kind assistance
generally, I am indebted to Excmo. Señor
Don Guillermo J. de Osma, Excmo. Señor Don
José Villegas, and Excmo. Señor Don José
Moreno Carbonero; to Señores Góngora and
Valladar, of Granada; and to Messrs Hauser
and Menet, and Mons. Lacoste, of Madrid.</p>

<h2><a name="GOLD_SILVER_AND_JEWEL_WORK" id="GOLD_SILVER_AND_JEWEL_WORK">GOLD, SILVER, AND JEWEL WORK</a></h2>

<p>The hyperbolic language of the ancients spoke
of Spain as filled throughout, upon her surface and
beneath her soil, with precious stones and precious
metals. Old writers&mdash;Strabo, Pliny, Aristoteles,
Pomponius Mela, and Diodorus Siculus&mdash;declare
that once upon a time a mountain fire, lighted
by shepherds in the Pyrenees and fanned into a
conflagration by the wind, heated the earth until
the ore within her entrails came bubbling to the
top and ran away in rivulets of molten gold and
silver, spreading all over Spain. The indigens
of Lusitania as they dug their fields were said to
strike their implements on nuggets half a pound
in weight. The heart of the Peninsula, between
the B&oelig;tis and the Annas rivers&mdash;that is, the
country of the Oretani and the Bastitani&mdash;was
fabled to abound in mines of gold. The traders
from Ph&oelig;nicia, we are told, discovered silver to
be so abundant with the Turdetani that &ldquo;the
vilest utensils of this people were composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
thereof, even to their barrels and their pots.&rdquo;
Accordingly these shrewd Ph&oelig;nicians, offering
worthless trinkets in exchange, loaded their ships
with silver to the water's edge, and even, when
their cargo was complete, fashioned their chains
and anchors of the residue.</p>

<p>In spite of their extravagance, upon the whole
these legends are not utterly devoid of truth.
&ldquo;Tradition,&rdquo; said so careful an authority as
Symonds, &ldquo;when not positively disproved should
be allowed to have its full value; and a sounder
historic sense is exercised in adopting its testimony
with due caution, than in recklessly rejecting it
and substituting guesses which the lack of
knowledge renders insubstantial.&rdquo; So with the
legends of the gold and silver treasure of the old-time
Spaniards. Besides, it seems unquestionable
that those fanciful assertions had their origin in
fact. Spain stood upon the western border of the
ancient world. Year in, year out, the sanguine
sun went seething down into the waters at her
western marge. Mariners from distant countries
viewed those sunsets and associated them with
Spain herself. Thus, hereabouts in the unclouded
south, would gold and silver be suggested by the
solar orb; or emerald and jacinth, pearl and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
amethyst and ruby, by the matchless colours of
the seldom-failing sunset.</p>

<p>Then, too, though not of course in fabulous
amount, the precious metals actually existed in
this land. Various of her rivers, such as the
Calom or Darro of Granada, the Tagus, the
Agneda, and the Sil, rolled down, together with
their current, grains of gold. &ldquo;Les Mores,&rdquo;
wrote Bertaut de Rouen of the first of these
rivers, &ldquo;en tiroient beaucoup autrefois; mais cela
a esté discontinué depuis à cause de la trop
grande dépense qu'il y faloit faire. Il est certain
que souvent on prend dans le Darro de petits
morceaux d'or, et il y a des gens qui sont
accoûtumez d'y en chercher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Centuries before this abbot wrote his book, the
Arab author of the geographical dictionary known
as the <i>Marasid Ithila</i> had made a similar remark
upon this gold-producing stream; and in the
sixteenth century I find an Ordinance of Granada
city prohibiting the townspeople from digging up
the river-bed unless it were to look for gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Probably, however, and in spite of what some
chroniclers suppose, the title Darro is not in
any way connected with the Latin words <i>dat
aurum</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two leagues from Guadarrama,&rdquo; wrote the
mineralogist William Bowles, about the middle of
the eighteenth century, &ldquo;opposite the town and
in the direction of San Ildefonso, is a deep valley
where one notices a vein of common quartz containing
some iron. Here, without the use of
glasses, I perceived a good many grains of
gold&hellip;. In Galicia grains of gold are found
on sandy hills, and one is astonished to observe
the wonderful works carried out by the Romans
to bring the sands together, wash them, and
extract the precious metal. Local tradition
affirms that this precious sand was destined for
the purses of three Roman empresses&mdash;Livia,
Agrippina, and Faustina&hellip;. I know a German
minister who employed his spare time in washing
these sands and collecting the gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Romans, it is true, profited very greatly
by the native wealth of the Peninsula. Helvius
enriched the treasury with 14,732 pounds of
Spanish silver bars and 17,023 pounds of silver
money; Cornelius Lentulus, with 1515 pounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
gold, 20,000 pounds of bar-silver, and 34,550
pounds in coin. Cato came back from his pro-consulship
with five-and-twenty thousand pounds
of silver bars, twelve thousand pounds of silver
money, and four hundred pounds of gold.
Seventy thousand pounds of coined silver fell to
the share of Flaccus, while Minutius exhibited
at his triumph eight thousand pounds of silver
bars, and three hundred thousand pounds of
silver coin.</p>

<p>Mines of silver,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> gold, and precious stones
were also fairly numerous in Spain. Moorish
authors wrote enthusiastically of the mines of
precious metals in or close to the Sierra Nevada.
&ldquo;Even at this day,&rdquo; said Bowles, &ldquo;the Moorish
mines may be distinguished from the Roman.
The Romans made the towers of their fortresses
of a round shape, in order to avoid as far as
possible the blows of the battering-ram; and
their miners, whether from habit or intentionally,
made the mouths of their mines round also. The
Moors, as strangers to this engine, built their
towers square and gave a square shape also to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the mouths of their mines. The round mouths of
Roman mines are yet to be seen at Riotinto and
other places, and the square mouths of Moorish
mines in the neighbourhood of Linares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emeralds were formerly extracted from a
mine at Moron, in the Sierra de Leyta; white
sapphires and agates at Cape de Gata,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> at the
eastern extremity of the Gulf of Almeria;
amethysts at Monte de las Guardas, near the
port of Plata, &ldquo;in a precipice (<i>sic</i>) about twenty
feet in depth.&rdquo; According to Laborde, garnets
have been discovered down to modern times &ldquo;in
a plain half-way on the road from Almeria to
Motril. They are very abundant there, particularly
in the bed of a ravine, formed by
rain-torrents, at the foot of a little hill, upon
which a great number of them are likewise
found. The emeralds are in the kingdom
of Seville, all the others in that of Granada.
It has been said for some time that a pit in
the mountain of Bujo, at Cape de Gata, contains
a great many precious stones; but none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
could be found there, notwithstanding the prolonged
and careful searches that were lately
made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver mines exist, or have existed, at Benasque,
Calzena, and Bielza, in Aragon; at Cuevas, near
Almeria; at Almodovar del Campo; at Zalamea,
in Extremadura; at Puerto Blanco, in Seville
province; in the Sierra de Guadalupe; at Fuente
de la Mina, near Constantina; and near Almazarron,
in the province of Carthagena. Not far
from this latter city was another mine, that sent
to Rome a daily yield of five-and-twenty thousand
drachmas, and was worked by forty thousand men.
Twenty thousand pounds in weight of pure silver
proceeded yearly from Asturias, Lusitania, and
Galicia. Hannibal extracted from a Pyrenean
mine three hundred pounds a day. The fair
Himilca, wife of Hasdrubal, was owner of a silver
mine at two leagues' distance from Linares.
Laborde wrote of this mine: &ldquo;It was reopened
in the seventeenth century, when a vein five feet
in breadth was found, from which many pieces
of silver were taken; the working of it, however,
has been neglected. It belongs to the town of
Baeza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same author, who wrote about one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
years ago, gives curious and instructive notices
of several other Spanish silver mines. &ldquo;The
mountains of the kingdom of Seville, on the
confines of Extremadura, towards Guadalcanal,
Alanis, Puerto Blanco, and Cazalla, which form a
part of the extremity of the chain of Sierra Morena,
contain several silver mines, which have been
worked. There is one of these in the Sierra
Morena, three miles from Guadalcanal, which to
all appearance must have been very rich: there
were three shafts for descending, the mouths of
which are still to be seen: it was worked in the
seventeenth century, and given up in 1653. It is
believed that it was inundated by the workmen,
in revenge for a new tax that was laid upon them.
Another silver mine was also worked formerly, a
league and a half from the other; it has a shaft,
and a gallery of ancient construction; the vein is
six feet in circumference, and is composed of spar
and quartz. There is also a third mine, a league
and a half from Guadalcanal, and half a league
south-east of the village of Alanis, in the middle
of a field; it is two feet wide; the Romans constructed
a gallery in it, from south to north; a
branch of it running eastward has been worked
since their time: it originally contained pyrites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and quartz, but it is by no means rich; there is
lead at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gold mines, or traces of them, have been found
in the neighbourhood of Molina in Aragon,
San Ildefonso in Old Castile, and Alocer in
Extremadura; in the Sierra de Leyta; in the
valley of Hecho in Aragon; and at Paradeseca
and Ponferrada&mdash;this latter town the <i>Interamnium
Flavium</i> of the Romans.</p>

<p>It is said that the chieftains of the ancient
Spaniards adorned their robes with rude embroidery
worked in gold, and that the men and
women of all ranks wore gold and silver bracelets.
These statements cannot now be either proved
or controverted. Gold or silver objects older
than the Roman domination have not been found
abundantly in Spain. Riaño describes a silver
bowl, conical in shape and evidently fashioned
on the wheel, engraved with Iberian characters
on one of its sides. A similar bowl was found
in Andalusia in the seventeenth century, full
of Iberian coins and weighing ten ounces. Gold
ornaments, such as earrings, and <i>torques</i> or collars
for the neck, have been discovered in Galicia
less infrequently than in the other Spanish regions,
and may be seen to-day in private collections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in the Royal Academy of History at Madrid,
and in the National Museum of Archæology.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Villa-amil y Castro has written fully of these
<i>torques</i> (Museo Español de Antigüedades, <i>Adornos
de oro encontrados en Galicia</i>). In nearly every
case, he says, they consist of a plain gold bar,
C-shaped and therefore not completely closed
into a ring, and with a knob at each extremity, as
though their pattern were suggested by the yoke
of cattle. One or two are decorated with a somewhat
rude design extending through a portion of
their length.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions a pair of curious,
kidney-shaped earrings was found, together with a
<i>torque</i>. These earrings, apparently of later workmanship
than the other ornament, are decorated
over all their surface, partly with a filigree design,
and partly with a fine, beadlike pattern executed
with a small chisel or graving tool in the manner
known in French as <i>fusé</i>, <i>guilloché</i>, or <i>hachié</i>.
Their material is hollow gold, and when discovered
they were filled with a substance resembling
powdered charcoal, mixed with a metallic
clay.</p>

<p>These ornaments are ascribed by most authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to an undetermined period somewhere
previous to the Roman domination. I think,
however, that less improbably they were produced
by Spanish craftsmen in imitation of the Roman
manner, and during the time of Roman rule in
the Peninsula. This would account for their
deficiencies of execution, and also for certain
characteristics which they evidently share with
Roman work.</p>

<p>We know that Rome imposed her usages on all
the peoples whom she subjugated. Consequently,
following this universal law, the Spaniards would
adopt, together with the lavish luxury of Rome,
the Roman ornaments and articles of jewellery.
Such were the <i>annulus</i> or finger-ring; the <i>fibula</i>,
a brooch or clasp for securing the cloak; the
<i>torgues</i> or neck-ring, more or less resembling
those in use among the Persians; and the <i>phalera</i>,
a round plate of gold, silver, or other metal,
engraved with any one of a variety of emblems,
worn upon the breast or stomach by the persons
of either sex, and very commonly bestowed upon
the Roman soldiers in reward of military service.
Then there were several kinds of earrings&mdash;the
variously-designed <i>stalagmium</i> or pendant, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<i>inaures</i>, or the <i>crotalium</i>, hung with pearls that
brushed together as their wearer walked, and
gratified her vanity by their rustling; and also
several kinds of bracelets&mdash;the gold or bronze
<i>armilla</i>, principally worn by men; the <i>periscelis</i>,
the <i>spathalium</i>, and the <i>dextrale</i>, worn round
the fleshy part of the right arm.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Discoveries of Roman jewellery and gold and
silver work have occurred from time to time in the
Peninsula; for example, at Espinosa de Henares
and (in 1840) near Atarfe, on the southern side
of the volcanic-looking Sierra Elvira, a few miles
from Granada. Riaño describes a Roman silver
dish found in a stone quarry at Otañez, in the
north of Spain. &ldquo;It weighs thirty-three ounces,
and is covered with an ornamentation of figures
in relief, some of which are gilt, representing
an allegorical subject of the source of medicinal
waters. In the upper part is a nymph who pours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
water from an urn over rocks; a youth collects
it in a vessel; another gives a cup of it to a sick
man; another fills with it a barrel which is placed
in a four-wheeled car to which are yoked two
mules. On each side of the fountain are altars on
which sacrifices and libations are offered. Round
it is the inscription: <span class="smcap">SALVS VMERITANA</span>, and at the
back are engraved, in confused characters, the
words: <span class="smcap">L. P. CORNELIANI. PIII</span>&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same author is of opinion that in the time
of the Romans &ldquo;objects of all kinds in gold and
silver were used in Spain to a very great extent,
for, notwithstanding the destruction of ages, we
still possess inscriptions which allude to silver
statues, and a large number of objects in the
precious metals exist in museums and private
collections.&rdquo; Doubtless, in the case of articles
and household utensils of smaller size&mdash;bowls,
dishes, and the like, or ornaments for the person&mdash;the
precious metals were made use of freely; but
when we hear of mighty objects as also made of
silver, <i>e.g.</i> principal portions of a building, we
might do well to bear in mind a couple of old
columns that were standing once not far from Cadiz,
on a spot where in the days preceding history a
temple sacred to the Spanish Hercules is rumoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to have been. Philostratus affirmed these columns
to be wrought of solid gold and silver, mixed
together yet in themselves without alloy. Strabo
reduced them modestly to brass; but it was reserved
for a curious Frenchman, the Père Labat,
who travelled in Spain in 1705, to warn us what
they really were. &ldquo;Elles sont sur cette langue de
terre, qui joint l'Isle de Léon à celle de Cadix;
car il faut se souvenir que c'est ainsi qu'on appelle
la partie Orientale, et la partie Occidentale de la
même Isle. Il y a environ une lieue de la porte
de Terre à ces vénérables restes de l'antiquité.
Nous nous en approchames, croyant justifier les
contes que les Espagnols en débitent. Mais nous
fûmes étrangement surpris de ne pas rencontrer
la moindre chose qui pût nous faire seulement
soupçonner qu'elles fussent d'une antiquité un peu
considérable. Nous vimes que ces deux tours
rondes, qui n'ont à présent qu'environ vingt pieds
de hauteur sur douze à quinze pieds de diamètre,
étoient d'une maçonnerie fort commune. Leurs
portes étoient bouchées, et nous convinmes tous
qu'elles avoient été dans leur jeune tems des
moulins à vent qu'on avoit abandonnés; il n'y a
ni inscriptions, ni bas-reliefs, ni reste de figures
quelconques. En un mot, rien qui méritât notre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
attention, ni qui recompensât la moindre partie de
la peine que nous avions prise pour les aller voir
de près. Car je les avois vue plus d'une fois du
grand chemin, où j'avois passé, et je devois me
contenter. Mais que ne fait-on pas quand on est
curieux, et aussi des&oelig;uvré que je l'étois alors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the usages of Roman Spain descended
to the Visigoths. The jewels of this people
manifest the double influence of Rome and of
Byzantium, and the latter influenced in its turn
from Eastern sources. We learn from that extraordinary
encyclopædia of early mediæval Spanish
lore&mdash;the <i>Etymologies</i> of Isidore of Beja&mdash;that the
Visigothic women decked themselves with earrings,
necklaces, and bracelets, set with precious stones
of fabulous price. Leovigild is stated by the same
writer to have been the first of the Visigothic
princes to use the insignia of royalty. One of
his coins (engraved in Florez) represents him
with an imperial crown surmounted by a cross
resembling that of the Byzantines. Coins of a
similar design, and also bearing the imperial crown,
were minted at Toledo, Cordova, or Merida, in
the reigns of Chindaswint, Wamba, Ervigius, and
Egica.</p>

<p>But the true fountain-head of all our modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
knowledge respecting the jewellery of Visigothic
Spain is in the wonderful crosses, crowns, and
other ornaments discovered in 1858 upon the site
of some old Christian temple, two leagues distant
from Toledo. These objects, known collectively
as &ldquo;the treasure of Guarrazar,&rdquo; were stumbled
on by certain peasants after a heavy storm had
washed away a quantity of earth. Some were
destroyed upon the spot; others were sold to the
Toledo silversmiths and melted down by these
barbarians of our day; but fortunately the greater
part remained intact, or very nearly so. There
were in all, composed exclusively of gold and
precious stones, eleven crowns, two crosses containing
legible inscriptions, fragments such as the
arms of a processional cross, and many single
stones which time had doubtless separated from
the crosses or the crowns.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Part of this treasure passed in some mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
way to France, and is now in the Cluny Museum
at Paris. The rest is in the Royal Armoury at
Madrid. Paris can boast possession of nine of the
crowns; Madrid, of two, together with a fragment
of a third&mdash;this latter of a balustrade or basket
pattern. Five of the nine crowns preserved at
Paris are fashioned of simple hoops of gold. The
most important of the five, the crown of Recceswinth,
who ruled in Spain from 650 to 672 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,
consists of two hinged semicircles of hollow gold,
about a finger's-breadth across the interspace. It
measures just over eight inches in diameter and
four inches in depth. Both the upper and the
lower rims are decorated to the depth of nearly
half an inch with a design of four-pointed floral
or semi-floral figures within minute circles.
Amador de los Ríos has recognized this same
design in the frieze of certain buildings at
Toledo, and in the edges of mosaic discovered
at Italica and Lugo, as well as in the Balearic
Islands. The interstices of this design upon the
crown are filled with a kind of red enamel or
glaze, the true nature of which has not been
definitely ascertained. Riaño calls it &ldquo;a delicate
ornamentation of <i>cloisonné</i> work, which encloses
a substance resembling red glass.&rdquo; The centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the crown is filled with three rows of large
stones, principally pearls and sapphires. There are
also several onyxes, a stone which in those days
was held in great esteem. The spaces between
the rows of stones are ornamented with a somewhat
rudimentary design of palm branches, the leaves
of which appear to have been filled or outlined
with the kind of red enamel I have spoken of.</p>

<p>This crown is suspended by four gold chains
containing each of them five leaf-shaped links,
<i>percées à jour</i>. The chains unite at a gold rosette
in the form of a double lily, terminated by a stoutish
capital of rock-crystal. This in its turn is capped
by another piece of crystal holding the final stem
of gold which served as a hook for hanging up
the crown. Suspended from the gold rosette by
a long chain is a handsome cross, undoubtedly of
more elaborate workmanship, studded with union
pearls and monster sapphires. Amador believed
this ornament to be a brooch. If this were so it
is, of course, improperly appended here. Twenty-four
gold chains hang from the lower border of
the crown, concluding in pyriform sapphires of
large size. Each sapphire is surmounted by a
small, square frame of gold containing coloured
glass, and above this, in each of three-and-twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the chains, is one of the golden letters forming
the inscription, &#9769; <span class="smcap">RECCESVINTHVS REX OFFERET</span>.</p>

<p>Besides this crown there are at Paris&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A similar though slighter crown, the body
of which is studded with fifty-four magnificent
stones. A cross, now kept apart in the same
collection, is thought by Spanish experts to have
once been pendent from the crown. If so, the
latter was perhaps presented to the sanctuary by
one Sonnica, probably a Visigothic magnate, and
not a woman, as the termination of the name
induced some foreign antiquaries to suppose.
The cross is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p>(2) Three crowns of plain design consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hoops of gold with primitive <i>repoussé</i> decoration,
and, in the case of one, with precious stones.</p>

<p>(3) Four crowns, each with a pendent cross.
The pattern is a basket-work or set of balustrades
of thin gold hollow plates (not, as Riaño stated,
massive) with precious stones about the intersections
of the bars or meshes, and others hanging
from the lower rim. Three of these crowns have
three rows or tiers of what I call the balustrade;
the other crown has four.</p>

<p>The custom of offering votive crowns to
Christian temples was taken by the emperors of
Constantinople from heathen peoples of the
eastern world. In Spain this custom, introduced
by Recared, outlived by many years the ruin of
the Visigothic monarchy&mdash;survived, in fact, until
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Thus in 891
Alfonso the Third presented to the monastery
of San Adrian and Santa Natalia four crowns of
gold and three of silver, while just a hundred
years afterwards Ordoño the Second presented
three silver crowns to the monastery of Samos.
Other crowns were offered by the prelates and
the secular nobility.</p>

<p>Returning to the crowns of Guarrazar, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
has been great controversy as to whether these
were worn upon the head. Some experts think
they must have been so worn; and in this case
the rings upon the rim, through which the chains
are passed, would seem to have been added on
the presentation of these objects to the sanctuary.
Lasteyrie, on the other hand, considered that the
crowns were merely votive and were never meant
for personal use, arguing that the rings were
fixed about the border from the very moment
when the crowns were made;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but Amador
ingeniously replied to this by pointing out that
in a few of the old Castilian coins&mdash;for instance,
one of Sancho the Third&mdash;the crown, with rings
about its rim, is actually upon the monarch's
head. It is possible, adds the same authority,
that these were old votive crowns proceeding
from some church, although he thinks it still
more likely that they were fashioned with the
rings attached to them. We should remember,
too, the hinge which serves to open and close the
body of these crowns. It is difficult to guess
the purpose of this hinge, unless it were to fit the
crown more comfortably on the head.</p>

<p>Of that portion of the treasure of Guarrazar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which has remained at Madrid (Plate <a href="#img_22.jpg">i</a>.), the
most important object is the votive crown of King
Swinthila, son of Recared, and described as &ldquo;one
of the most illustrious and unlucky princes that ever
occupied the throne of Atawulf.&rdquo; This crown
measures nine inches in diameter by two and a
half in height. It consists of thin gold plates
united at the edge, leaving, between the inner and
the outer side, a hollow space about a quarter
of an inch across. The exterior is divided into
a central horizontal hoop or band between two
others, somewhat narrower, at the top and bottom,
these last being slightly raised above the level of the
third. A triple row of precious stones, amounting
to one hundred and twenty-five pearls and
sapphires in the entire crown, surrounds the outer
surface of the same, the central band or zone of
which contains besides, wrought in <i>repoussé</i> on
the hoop, a simple circular device wherein each
centre is a sapphire or a pearl, though many of
these have fallen from their setting. The spaces
which describe these circles are superposed on
what looks like a red enamel retaining at this
moment all or nearly all its pristine brightness of
twelve hundred years ago. This substance was
believed by French investigators to be a coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
glass or paste,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but Amador, after protracted
chemical experiments, declared it to be layers of
cornelian. Some of these layers have fallen from
their grip, and if the crown be stirred are heard
to move within. It is worth remarking, too, that
the fillets which form the setting of the precious
stones were made apart and welded afterwards;
nor are these settings uniform in shape, but tally
in each instance with the outline of the gem.</p>

(<i>Royal Armoury, Madrid</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The chains which served for hanging up the
crown are four in number. As in the crown of
Recceswinth, each of them is composed of four
<i>repoussé</i> cinquefoil links adorned along their edge
with small gold beads minutely threaded on a
wire and fastened on by fusing. The chains converge
into an ornament shaped like two lilies
pointing stem to stem, so that the lower is inverted,
although they are divided by a piece of
faceted rock crystal.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Four gems are hung from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
either lily, and issuing from the uppermost of
these a strong gold hook attaches to the final
length of chain.</p>

<p>Possibly the chain and cross now hanging
through the circuit of the crown were not originally
part of it. This cross is most remarkable.
It has four arms of equal length, gracefully curved,
and is wrought of plates of gold in duplicate,
fastened back to back by straps of gold along the
edges. The centre holds a piece of crystal in
the midst of pearls and gold bead work threaded
on a wire of the same metal and attached by
fusion. Several fairly large stones are hung from
the lateral and lower arms of the cross by small
gold chains.</p>

<p>The letters hanging from Swinthila's crown are
cut and punched from thin gold plates. Their
decoration is a zigzag ornament backed by the
same mysterious crimson substance as the circular
devices on the hoop. Hanging from the letters
are pearls, sapphires, and several imitation stones&mdash;particularly
imitation emeralds&mdash;in paste.</p>

<p>The cross before the letters points to a custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of that period. We find it also on Swinthila's
coins, and those of other Visigothic kings. Of the
letters themselves twelve have been recovered,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9769;  SV  TI  NV  REX  OFF  T</p>

<p>The chains, however, or fragments of them,
amount to twenty-three&mdash;precisely (if we count
the cross) the number needed to complete the
dedication.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The Royal Armoury contains another crown, a
great deal smaller and less ornamented than
Swinthila's. The body of this crown, which was
presented by the finder to the late Queen Isabella
the Second, is just a hoop of gold, two inches
deep and five across, hinged like the more
elaborate and larger crowns, but merely decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with a fine gold spiral at the rims, a zigzag
pattern in <i>repoussé</i>, and a rudely executed scale-work.
The dedication on this cross is in the
centre of the hoop, and says&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9769; OFFERET MVNVSCVLVM S<span style="text-decoration: overline;">CO</span> STEFANO<br />
THEODOSIVS ABB<span style="text-decoration: overline;">A</span></p>

<p>We do not know who Theodosius was, but
Amador, judging from the simple decoration of
this crown, believes him to have been a priest
of lower rank, and by no means a dignitary of
the Visigothic church.</p>

<p>A votive cross also forms part of this collection,
which has a simple sunk device along the edges
and seven pendent stones, two of these hanging
from each of the lateral arms, and three, a little
larger, from the lower arm. The inscription,
which is rough in the extreme, appears to be the
work of some illiterate craftsman, and has been
interpreted with difficulty:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">IN NOMINE DEI: IN NOMINE S<span style="text-decoration: overline;">CI</span> OFFERET<br />

<p>This reading gives an extra letter at the end,
which may be construed as <i>Episcopus</i>&mdash;or anything
else, according to the student's fancy.</p>

<p>I may close my notice of this collection in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Royal Armoury at Madrid by drawing attention
to a greenish, semi-opaque stone, three-quarters
of an inch in height. It is engraved <i>en creux</i>
upon two facets with the scene of the Annunciation.
The gem itself is commonly taken for an
emerald, of which, referring to the glyptic art
among the Visigoths, the learned Isidore remarked
that &ldquo;<i>Sculpentibus quoque gemmas nulla gratior
oculorum refectio est.</i>&rdquo; I shall insert a sketch of
the cutting on this stone as a tailpiece to the
chapter, and here append a full description.
&ldquo;The Virgin listens standing to the Archangel
Gabriel, who communicates to her the will of
the Almighty. Before her is a jar, from which
projects the stem of a lily, emblematic of the
chaste and pure, that reaches to her breast.
Her figure is completely out of measurement.
Upon her head appears to be a <i>nimbus</i> or
<i>amiculum</i>; her breast is covered with a broad and
folded <i>fascia</i>, enveloping her arms, while her
tunic, reaching to the ground, conceals one of her
feet. The angel in the cutting on the stone is at
the Virgin's right. His attitude is that of one
who is conveying tidings. Large wings folded
upon his shoulders and extending nearly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
ground are fitted to his form, better drawn and
livelier than the Virgin's. He executes his holy
mission with his right hand lifted. His dress is
a tunic in small folds, over which is a cloak
fastened by a brooch and fitting closely. Upon
his head he wears a kind of helmet.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The drawing of this design upon the stone is
most bizarre and barbarous; for the Virgin's head
is so completely disproportioned that it forms the
one-third part of her entire person.</p>

<p>The merit of all this Visigothic gem or gold and
silver work has been extolled too highly by the
French and Spanish archæologists.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is, however,
greatly interesting. Rudely and ponderously
magnificent, it tells us of a people who as yet
were almost wholly strangers to the true artistic
sense. Such were the Visigoths and the Spaniards
of the Visigothic era, of all of whom I have
observed elsewhere that &ldquo;serfdom was the distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
mark of the commons; arrogance, of
the nobility; avarice, and ambition of temporal and
political power, of the clergy; regicide and tumult,
of the crown.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> These crowns of Guarrazar proclaim
to us in plainest language that the volume of
the stones, and showiness and glitter of the precious
metal were accorded preference of every other
factor&mdash;the <i>pondus auri</i> preference of the <i>manus
artificis</i>. We gather, too, from documents and
chronicles and popular tradition, that the Visigothic
princes, as they set apart their stores of treasure in
secluded caves or in the strong rooms of their
palaces, were ever captivated and corrupted by the
mere intrinsic worth in opposition to the nobler
and æsthetic value of the craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Thus we are told that Sisenand owned a plate
of gold (no word is said of its design or style)
five hundred pounds in weight, proceeding from
the royal treasure of his race, and which, long
years before, had been presented by the nobleman
Accio to King Turismund. When Sisenand was
conspiring to dethrone Swinthila, he called on
Dagobert the king of France to come to his
support, and promised him, as recompense, this
golden plate. The French king lent his help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
forthwith, and then, as soon as Turismund was
seated on the throne of Spain, despatched an
embassy to bring the coveted vessel to his court.
Sisenand fulfilled his word and placed the envoys
in possession of the plate, but since his subjects,
rising in rebellion, wrenched it from their power
and kept it under custody, he compensated
Dagobert by a money payment of two hundred
thousand <i>sueldos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Innumerable narratives and legends dwell
upon the treasure taken by the Moors on entering
Spain. Such as relate the battle of the
Guadalete, or the Lake of Janda (as it is also
called by some authorities), agree that when the
fatal day was at an end the riderless steed of
Roderick was found imbedded in the mire,
wearing a saddle of massive gold adorned with
emeralds and rubies. According to Al-Makkari,
that luckless monarch's boots were also made of
gold studded with precious stones, while the
Muslim victors, stripping the Visigothic dead,
identified the nobles by the golden rings upon
their fingers, those of a less exalted rank by
their silver rings, and the slaves by their rings
of copper. The widow of the fallen king was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
also famous for her stores of jewellery. Her
name was Eila or Egilona (Umm-Asim of the
Moors), but she was known besides as &ldquo;the
lady of the beautiful necklaces.&rdquo; After being
made a prisoner she was given in marriage to
the young prince Abd-al-Azis, who grew to love
her very greatly, and received from her, &ldquo;seeing
that she still retained sufficient of her royal
wealth,&rdquo; the present of a crown.</p>

<p>Muza, on returning to the East, is said to
have drawn near to Damascus with a train of
thirty waggons full of Spanish silver, gold, and
precious stones. Tarik ben Ziyed, marching in
triumph through the land, secured at Cordova,
Amaya, and other towns and capitals, enormous
store of &ldquo;pearls, arms, dishes, silver, gold, and
other jewels in unprecedented number.&rdquo; One
object, in particular, is mentioned with insistency
by nearly all the chronicles, both Mussulman
and Christian. Quoting from the <i>Pearl of
Marvels</i> of Ibn Alwardi, this was &ldquo;the table
which had belonged to God's prophet, Solomon
(health be to both of them). It was of green
emeralds, and nothing fairer had been ever seen
before. Its cups were golden and its plates of
precious jewels, one of them specked with black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and white.&rdquo; All manner of strange things are
said about this table, though most accounts
describe it as consisting of a <i>single</i> emerald.
Perhaps it was of malachite, or of the bright
green serpentine stone extracted formerly as well
as nowadays from the Barranco de San Juan
at Granada, and several other spots in Spain.
Bayan Almoghreb says it was of gold mixed
with a little silver and surrounded by three gold
rings or collars; the first containing pearls, the
second rubies, and the third emeralds. Al-Makkari
describes it as &ldquo;green, with its 365 feet and
borders of a single emerald.&rdquo; Nor is it known
for certain where this &ldquo;table&rdquo; fell into the hands
of Tarik. Probably he found it in the principal
Christian temple at Toledo&mdash;that is to say, the
Basilica of Santa María. Ibn Alwardi says that
in the <i>aula regia</i>, or palace of the Visigothic kings,
the lancers of the Moorish general broke down
a certain door, discovering &ldquo;a matchless quantity
of gold and silver plate,&rdquo; together with the
&ldquo;table.&rdquo; Doubtless this strong room was the same
referred to in the following lines. &ldquo;It was for
ever closed; and each time that a Christian king
began to reign he added to its door a new and
powerful fastening. In this way as many as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
four and twenty padlocks were gathered on the
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the most explicit and informative of
all these ancient authors is Ibn Hayyan, who says;
&ldquo;The table had its origin in the days of Christian
rulers. It was the custom in those times that
when a rich man died he should bequeath a legacy
to the churches. Proceeding from the value of
these gifts were fashioned tables, thrones, and
other articles of gold and silver, whereon the
clergy bore the volumes of their gospel when
they showed them at their ceremonies. These
objects they would also set upon their altars to
invest them with a further splendour by the
ornament thereof. For this cause was the table
at Toledo, and the [Visigothic] monarchs vied
with one another in enriching it, each of them
adding somewhat to the offerings of his predecessor,
till it surpassed all other jewels of its
kind and grew to be renowned exceedingly. It
was of fine gold studded with emeralds, pearls,
and rubies, in such wise that nothing similar had
ever been beheld. So did the kings endeavour
to increase its richness, seeing that this city was
their capital, nor did they wish another to contain
more splendid ornaments or furniture. Thus was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the table resting on an altar of the church, and
here the Muslims came upon it, and the fame of
its magnificence spread far abroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another chronicle affirms that Tarik found the
&ldquo;table&rdquo; at a city called Almeida, now perhaps
Olmedo. &ldquo;He reached Toledo, and leaving a
detachment there, advanced to Guadalajara and
the [Guadarrama] mountains. These he crossed
by the pass which took his name, and reached,
upon the other side, a city called Almeida or <i>The
Table</i>, for there had been discovered the table of
Solomon the son of David, and the feet and
borders of it, numbering three hundred and sixty-five,
were of green emerald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In any case this venerated jewel gave considerable
trouble to its captors. When envious Muza
followed up the march of Tarik, his lieutenant,
he demanded from him all the spoil, and in
particular the ever-famous table. Tarik surrendered
this forthwith, but after slyly wrenching
off a leg. Muza perceived the breakage, and
inquired for the missing piece. &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo;
said the other; &ldquo;'twas thus that I discovered it.&rdquo;
Muza then ordered a new leg of gold to be made
for the table, as well as a box of palm leaves, in
which it was deposited. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Ibn Hayyan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
&ldquo;is known to be one of the reasons why Tarik
worsted Muza in the dispute they had before
the Caliph as to their respective conquests.&rdquo;
So it proved. Ibn Abdo-l-Haquem<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> relates that
Muza appeared before the Caliph Al-Walid and
produced the table. Tarik interposed and said
that he himself had taken it, and not the other
leader. &ldquo;Give it into my hands,&rdquo; the Caliph
answered, &ldquo;that I may see if any piece of it be
wanting,&rdquo; and found, indeed, that one of its feet
was different from the rest. &ldquo;Ask Muza,&rdquo; interrupted
Tarik, &ldquo;for the missing foot, and if he
answer from his heart, then shall his words be
truth.&rdquo; Accordingly Al-Walid inquired for the
foot, and Muza made reply that he had found
the table as it now appeared; but Tarik with
an air of triumph drew forth the missing piece
which he himself had broken off, and said: &ldquo;By
this shall the Emir of the Faithful recognize that
I am speaking truth; that I it was who found
the table.&rdquo; And thereupon Al-Walid credited his
words and loaded him with gifts.</p>

<p>Comparing the statements of these writers, we
may be certain that the &ldquo;table&rdquo; was a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
desk of Visigothic or, more probably, Byzantine
workmanship, for holding the gospels on the
feast-days of the national church. Probably, too,
seeing that a palm-leaf box was strong enough to
keep it in, its size was inconsiderable. Its value,
on the statement of Ibn Abdo-l-Haquem, was
two hundred thousand <i>dinares</i>.</p>

<p>The sum of my remarks upon the Visigothic
jewel-work is this. Distinguished by a coarse
though costly splendour, we find in it a mingled
Roman and Byzantine source, although it was
upon the whole inferior to these styles, being
essentially, as Amador observes, &ldquo;an imitative
and decadent art.&rdquo; Yet it did not succumb before
the Moors, but lurked for refuge in the small
Asturian monarchy, and later, issuing thence, extended
through the kingdom of León into Castile.
We find its clearest characteristics in such objects
as the Cross of Angels and the Cross of Victory.
Then, later still, it is affected and regenerated by the
purely oriental art of the invader; and lastly, till the
wave of the Renaissance floods the western world,
by Gothic influences from across the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>A similar sketch may be applied to other arts
and crafts of Spain&mdash;particularly furniture and
architecture.</p>

Rosmithal five hundred years ago to time-economizing
tourists of our century, have been
continually astonished at the prodigal richness
of her sanctuaries. Upon this point I quote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a typical extract from the narrative of Bertaut de
Rouen. &ldquo;The treasure of this church,&rdquo; he said
of Montserrat, &ldquo;is wonderfully precious, and particularly
so by reason of two objects that belong
to it. The first is a crown of massive gold of
twenty pounds in weight, covered with pearls,
with ten stars radiating from it also loaded with
large pearls and diamonds of extraordinary value.
This crown took forty years to make, and is valued
at two millions of gold money. The second
object is a gold crown entirely covered with
emeralds, most of them of an amazing size. Many
are worth five thousand crowns apiece. The
reliquary, too, is of extraordinary richness, as also
a service of gold plate studded with pearls,
donated by the late emperor for use in celebrating
Mass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similar accounts to the above exist in quantities,
relating to every part of Spain and every period
of her history.</p>

<p>Reverting to the earlier Middle Ages, a few
conspicuous objects thus presented to the Spanish
Church require to be briefly noted here. Famous
chalices are those of Santo Domingo de Silos
(eleventh century), made to the order of Abbot
Domingo in honour of San Sebastian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
showing the characteristic Asturian filigree-work;
and of San Isidoro of León, made in 1101 by
order of Urraca Fernandez, sister of the fourth
Alfonso. The latter vessel, inscribed with the
dedication of <i>Urraca Fredinandi</i>, has an agate
cup and foot. A remarkably handsome silver-gilt
chalice and patine (thirteenth century) belong
to Toledo cathedral. The height of this chalice
is thirteen inches, and the diameter of its bowl,
which has a conical shape, eight and a half inches.
Inside and out the bowl is smooth, but midway
between the bowl and the foot is a massive knot
or swelling in the stem, and on the knot the
emblematic lion, eagle, bull, and angel are
chiselled in high relief. Below the knot is a ring
of graceful rosettes. The patine which accompanies
this chalice measures twelve inches in
diameter. It has upon it, thinly engraved within
a slightly sunk centre with a scalloped edge, the
figure of Christ upon the cross, between the
Virgin and St John. This central group of
figures and the border of the plate are each
surrounded with a narrow strip of decoration.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Valencia has a beautiful and
early cup asserted to be the veritable Holy Grail
(<i>greal</i>, <i>garal</i>, or <i>gradal</i>, in the old Castilian), &ldquo;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which,&rdquo; wrote Ford with his accustomed irony, &ldquo;so
many are shown in different orthodox <i>relicarios</i>.&rdquo;
However this may be, the chalice of Valencia is
particularly handsome. According to Riaño it
consists of &ldquo;a fine brown sardonyx which is tastefully
moulded round the lip. The base is formed
of another inverted sardonyx. These are united
by straps of pure gold. The stem is flanked by
handles, which are inlaid with delicate arabesque
in black enamel. Oriental pearls are set round
the base and stem, which alternate with rubies,
sapphires, and emeralds. This chalice is a work
of the Roman imperial epoch, and the mounts
are of a later date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A series of Spanish chalices, beginning chronologically
with specimens which date from the
early Middle Ages, and terminating with the
chalice, made in 1712, of Santa María la Blanca
of Seville, was shown in 1892 at the Exposición
Histórico-Europea of Madrid. Among the finer
or most curious were chalices proceeding from the
parish church of Játiva, Las Huelgas, and Seville
cathedral, and the Plateresque chalices of Calatayud,
Granada, and Alcalá de Henares. Another
chalice which is greatly interesting because of
the date inscribed on it, is one which was presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to Lugo cathedral by a bishop of that diocese,
Don Garcia Martinez de Bahamonde (1441&ndash;1470).
The workmanship, though prior to the sixteenth
century, is partly Gothic. An article by José
Villa-amil y Castro, dealing with all these chalices,
will be found in the <i>Boletín de la Sociedad
Española de Excursiones</i> for April, 1893.</p>

<p>A small exhibition was held at Lugo in August
1896. Here were shown sixteen chalices, nearly
all of them of merit from the point of view of
history or art. Such are the chalice of San
Rosendo, proceeding from the old monastery
of Celanova; the Gothic chalices of Tuy
cathedral, Lugo cathedral, Santa María del
Lucio, Santa Eulalia de Guilfrei, San Pedro
de Puertomarín, and the Franciscan friars of
Santiago; and the chalice and patine of Cebrero
(twelfth century), in which it is said that on a
certain occasion in the fifteenth century the wine
miraculously turned to actual blood, and the Host
to actual flesh, in order to convince a doubting
priest who celebrated service.</p>

<p>The Cross of Angels and the Cross of Victory&mdash;presents,
respectively, from Alfonso the Chaste
and Alfonso the Great&mdash;are now preserved at
Oviedo, in the Camara Santa of that stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
temple. The former of these crosses, fancied by
credulous people to be the handiwork of angels&mdash;whence
its title<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;was made in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 808. It consists
of four arms of equal length, radiating from
a central rosette (Pl. <a href="#img_36.jpg">ii</a>.). The core or <i>alma</i> is of
wood covered with a double plate of richly decorated
gold, chased in the finest filigree (indicative
already of the influence of Cordova) and thickly
strewn with sapphires, amethysts, topazes, and
cornelians. Other stones hung formerly from six
small rings upon the lower border of the arms.
The cross is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>&ldquo;Susceptum placide maneat hoc in honore Dei<br />
Offeret Adefonsus humilis servus Xti<br />
Hoc signo tuetur pius<br />
Hoc signo vincitur inimicus.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Quisquis auferre presumpserit mihi<br />
Fulmine divino intereat ipse<br />
Nisi libens ubi voluntas dederit mea<br />
Hoc opus perfectum est in Era DCCXLVI.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p class="caption">THE CROSS OF VICTORY<br />

</div>

<p>The other cross (Pl. <a href="#img_42.jpg">iii</a>.) is more than twice as
large, and measures just one yard in height by two
feet four and a half inches in width. Tradition
says that the primitive, undecorated wooden core of
this cross was carried against the Moors by King
Pelayo. The ornate casing, similar to that upon
the Cross of Angels, was added later, and contains
152 gems and imitation gems. The following
inscription tells us that this casing was made
at the Castle of Gauzon in Asturias, in the year
828:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>&ldquo;Susceptum placide maneat hoc in honore Dei, quod offerent<br />
Famuli Christi Adefonsus princeps et Scemaena Regina;<br />
Quisquis auferre hoc donoria nostra presumpserit<br />

Et operatum est in castello Gauzon anno regni nostri.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10%;">XLII. <i>discurrente Era</i> DCCCLXVI.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>These crosses are processional. Others which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were used for the same purpose are those of San
Sebastián de Serrano (Galicia), San Munio de
Veiga, Santa María de Guillar (Lugo), San Mamed
de Fisteos, and Santa María de Arcos. The five
preceding crosses are of bronze; those of Baamorto
and San Adriano de Lorenzana are respectively
of silver, and of wood covered with silver plates,
and all were shown at the Lugo exhibition I have
spoken of.</p>

<p>Besides the Cross of Victory or Pelayo, and the
Cross of Angels, interesting objects preserved at
Oviedo are a small diptych presented by Bishop
Don Gonzalo (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1162&ndash;1175), and the <i>Arca Santa</i>
used for storing saintly relics. This beautiful
chest, measuring three feet nine inches and a half
in length by twenty-eight inches and a half in
height, is considered by Riaño to be of Italian
origin, and to date from between the tenth and
twelfth centuries.</p>

<p>Another handsome box belonging to the cathedral
of Astorga was once upon a time the
property of Alfonso the Third and his queen
Jimena, whose names it bears&mdash;<span class="smcap">ADEFONSVS REX:
SCEMENA REGINA</span>. The workmanship is consequently
of the close of the ninth or the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the tenth century. The material is wood
covered with <i>repoussé</i> silver plates on which are
figured angels and birds, together with the eagle
and the ox as emblems of the evangelists John
and Luke, whose names are also to be read upon
the casket.</p>

<p>Next to the sword, no object in the history of
mediæval Spain was more profoundly popular or
venerated than the <i>relicario</i>. This in its primitive
form was just a small receptacle, such as a vase or
urn of gold or silver, ivory or crystal, used by the
laity or clergy for treasuring bones, or hairs, or
other relics of the Virgin, or the Saviour, or the
saints. In private families a holy tooth, or toe,
or finger thus preserved would often, as though
it were some Eastern talisman, accompany its
credulous possessor to the battlefield.</p>

<p>As time went on, the urn or vase was commonly
replaced by chests or caskets made by Moorish
captives, or by tranquil and respected Moorish
residents within the territory of the Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
or wrested from the infidel in war and offered
by the Spanish kings or nobles to their churches.
Here they were kept on brackets, or suspended
near the altar by a chain<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of silver, gold, or iron.
Among the Moors themselves such chests and
caskets served, according to their richness or
capacity, for storing perfumes, clothes, or jewels,
or as a present from a bridegroom to his bride;
and since the sparsely-furnished Oriental room
contains no kind of wardrobe, cabinet, or chest
of drawers, their use in Moorish parts of Spain
was universal.</p>

<p>A typical Moorish casket of this kind (Plate <a href="#img_46.jpg">iv</a>.)
is now in the cathedral of Gerona. It measures
fifteen inches in length by nine across, fastens
with a finely ornamented band and clasp of
bronze, and is covered with thin silver-gilt plates
profusely decorated with a bead and floral pattern
superposed upon a box of non-decaying wood&mdash;possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
larch or cedar. A Cufic inscription along
the lower part of the lid was formerly interpreted
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of God. (May) the blessing of
God, prosperity and fortune and perpetual felicity
be (destined) for the servant of God, Alhakem,
Emir of the Faithful, because he ordered (this
casket) to be made for Abdul Walid Hischem,
heir to the throne of the Muslims. It was finished
by the hands of Hudzen, son of Bothla.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">MOORISH CASKET<br />
(<i>Gerona Cathedral</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>It is supposed, however, that the part of this
inscription which contains the maker's name was
rendered incorrectly by Riaño, who followed, on
this point, Saavedra, Fita, and other archæologists;
and that the casket was made to the order
of Djaudar, as a gift to the heir to the throne,
Abulwalid Hischem, the actual workmen being
two slaves, Bedr and Tarif. That is to say, the
name Hudzen is now replaced by Djaudar, whom
Dozy mentions in his history of the Mussulman
domination in Spain, and who is known to have
been a eunuch high in favour with Alhakem,
Hischem's father. These princes ruled at Cordova
in the latter half of the tenth century and the
beginning of the eleventh.</p>

<p>Spanish-Moorish caskets (<i>arquetas</i>) of ivory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
silver, or inlaid work, are also preserved in the
South Kensington Museum, the Archæological
Museum at Madrid, and the cathedrals of Braga,
Tortosa, and Oviedo. There is no reason to
doubt that all these boxes were made in Spain,
although an Eastern and particularly Persian
influence is very noticeable in their scheme of
decoration.</p>

<p>Two silver caskets which were once in the
church of San Isidoro at León are now in the
Madrid Museum. The smaller and plainer of
the two, elliptical in shape and measuring five
inches in length by two inches and a half in depth,
is covered with a leaf and stem device outlined in
black enamel. A Cufic inscription of a private
and domestic import, also picked out with black
enamel, runs along the top. The lid is ornamented,
like the body of the box, with leaves and stems
surrounded by a Grecian border, and fastens with
a heart-shaped clasp secured by a ring.</p>

<p>The other, more elaborate, and larger box
measures eight inches long by five in height. In
shape it is a parallelogram, with a deeply bevelled
rather than&mdash;as Amador describes it&mdash;a five-sided
top. Bands of a simple winding pattern outlined
in black enamel on a ground of delicate niello-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
run round the top and body of the casket.
The central band upon the lower part contains a
Cufic inscription of slight interest. Some of the
letters terminate in leaves. The bevelled lid is
covered with groups of peacocks&mdash;symbolic, among
Mohammedans, of eternal life&mdash;outlined in black
enamel. These birds are eight in all, gathered in
two groups of four about the large and overlapping
hinges. Four leaves, trifoliate, in <i>repoussé</i>, one
beneath the other, decorate the clasp, which opens
out into a heart containing, also in <i>repoussé</i>, two
inverted peacocks looking face to face. Between
the birds this heart extremity is pierced for the
passage of a ring.</p>

<p>Amador de los Ríos considers that both caskets
were made between the years 1048 and 1089.</p>

<p>The use of coloured enamel in the manufacture
of these boxes dates, or generally so, from somewhat
later. Although the history of enamelling
in Spain is nebulous and contradictory in the
extreme, we know that caskets in <i>champlevé</i> enamel
on a copper ground, with figures either flat or
hammered in a bold relief, became abundant here.
Two, from the convent of San Marcos at León, and
dating from the thirteenth century, are now in the
Madrid Museum. Labarte says that the lids of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
these enamelled reliquaries were flat until the
twelfth century, and of a gable form thenceforward.</p>

<p class="caption">ALTAR-FRONT IN ENAMELLED BRONZE<br />

</div>

<p>Other old objects&mdash;boxes, triptyches, statuettes,
incensories, book-covers, crucifixes, and processional
crosses&mdash;partly or wholly covered with
enamel, belong or recently belonged to the
Marquises of Castrillo and Casa-Torres, the Count
of Valencia de Don Juan, and Señor Escanciano.
All, or nearly all, of these are thought to have proceeded
from Limoges (Pl. <a href="#img_50.jpg">v</a>.). <i>Champlevé</i> enamel
is also on the tiny &ldquo;Crucifix of the Cid&rdquo; (Pl. <a href="#img_52.jpg">vi</a>.) at
Salamanca, as well as on the Virgin's throne in
the gilt bronze statuette of the Virgin de la Vega
at San Esteban in the same city.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Of this image,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
although it properly belongs to another heading of
my book, I think it well to give a reproduction here
(Plate <a href="#img_54.jpg">vii</a>.). I will also mention, in spite of its
presumably foreign origin, the enamelled altar-front
of San Miguel de Excelsis in Navarre&mdash;a
small sanctuary constructed by a mediæval cavalier
who, by an accident occasioned by the dark,
murdered his father and mother in lieu of his
wife.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This altar-front, conspicuously Byzantine
in its style, measures four feet three inches high
by seven feet five inches long, and is now employed
as the <i>retablo</i> of the little church which
stands in solitary picturesqueness on the lofty
mountain-top of Aralar. The figures, coloured in
relief upon a yellowish enamel ground, are those
of saints, and of a monarch and his queen&mdash;possibly
King Sancho the Great, who is believed to have
been the donor of the ornament. If this surmise
be accurate, the front would date from the eleventh
century.</p>

<p>I have said that the history of Spanish enamel-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
is both confused and scanty. The subject
in its general aspects has been studied by M.
Roulin, whose judgments will be found in the
<i>Revue de l'Art Ancien et Moderne</i>, and in his
article, &ldquo;Mobilier liturgique d'Espagne,&rdquo; published
in the <i>Revue de l'Art Chrétien</i> for 1903. M.
Roulin believes the altar-front of San Miguel in
Excelsis to be a Limoges product, not earlier than
the first half of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Ramírez de Arellano declares that no enamelling
at all was done in Spain before the invasion of the
Almohades. López Ferreiro, who as a priest had
access to the jealously secreted archives of Santiago
cathedral, gives us the names of Arias Perez,
Pedro Martinez, Fernan Perez, and Pedro Pelaez,
Galician enamellers who worked at Santiago in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Martin
Minguez says that enamelling was done at Gerona
in the fourteenth century, and Moorish enamels
were certainly produced at Cordova and Cuenca
from comparatively early in the Middle Ages.
A few obscure workers in enamel are mentioned
by Gestoso, in his <i>Diccionario de Artistas Sevillanos</i>,
as living at Seville in the fifteenth century,
though, in the entries which refer to them, little
is told us of their lives and nothing of their labours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
In the sixteenth century we obtain a glimpse of
two enamellers of Toledo&mdash;Lorenzo Marqués and
Andrés Ordoñez, and dating from the same
period the Chapter of the Military Orders of
Ciudad Real possesses a silver-gilt <i>porta-paz</i>
with enamelling done at Cuenca. However, our
notices of this branch of Spanish art have yet
to be completed.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE CRUCIFIX OF THE CID&rdquo;<br />
(<i>Salamanca Cathedral</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>A long array of royal gifts caused, in the
olden time, the treasure of Santiago cathedral
to be the richest and most varied in the
whole Peninsula, although at first this see was
merely suffragan to Merida. But early in the
twelfth century a scheming bishop, by name
Diego Gelmirez, intrigued at Rome to raise his
diocese to the dignity of an archbishopric. The
means by which he proved successful in the
end were far from irreproachable. &ldquo;Gelmirez,&rdquo;
says Ford (vol. ii. p. 666) &ldquo;was a cunning
prelate, and well knew how to carry his point; he
put Santiago's images and plate into the crucible,
and sent the ingots to the Pope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The original altar-front or parament (<i>aurea
tabula</i>) was made of solid gold. This altar-front
Gelmirez melted down to steal from it some
hundred ounces of the precious metal for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Pope, donating in its stead another front of gold
and silver mixed, wrought from the remaining
treasure of the sanctuary. Aymerich tells us
that the primitive frontal bore the figure of the
Saviour seated on a throne supported by the four
evangelists, blessing with his right hand, and
holding in his left the Book of Life. The four-and-twenty
elders (called by quaint Morales &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo;)
of the apocalypse were also gathered round
the throne, with musical instruments in their hands,
and golden goblets filled with fragrant essences.
At either end of the frontal were six of the apostles,
three above and three beneath, separated by
&ldquo;beautiful columns&rdquo; and surrounded by floral decoration.
The upper part was thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">HANC TABULAM DIDACUS PRÆSUL JACOBITA<br />

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">REX ERAT ANFONSUS GENER EJUS DUX RAIMUNDUS<br />

<p>This early altar-front has disappeared like its predecessor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it is not known precisely at what time;
but both Morales and Medina saw and wrote
about it in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Another ornament which Aymerich describes,
namely, the <i>baldaquino</i> or <i>cimborius</i>, has likewise
faded from the eyes of the profane, together with
three bronze caskets covered with enamel, and
stated by Morales to have contained the bones of
Saints Silvestre, Cucufate, and Fructuoso. One
of these caskets was existing in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The silver lamps were greatly celebrated.
Ambrosio de Morales counted &ldquo;twenty or
more&rdquo;; but Zepedano made their total mount to
fifty-one. The French invasion brought their
number down to three. Three of the oldest
of these lamps had been of huge dimensions,
particularly one, a present from Alfonso of
Aragon, which occupied the centre. The shape
of it, says Aymerich, was &ldquo;like a mighty mortar.&rdquo;
Seven was the number of its beaks, symbolic of
the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost; and each
beak contained a lamplet fed with oil of myrtles,
acorns, or olives.</p>

<p>All kinds of robberies and pilferings have thus
been perpetrated with the once abundant wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of Santiago.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The jealous care which keeps the
copious archives inaccessible to all the outside
world is in itself of sinister significance. It has
transpired, furthermore, that many of the bishops
have &ldquo;exchanged,&rdquo; or simply stolen, portions of the
holy property. Besides these clerical dilapidations,
a cartload, weighing half a ton, was carried
off by Marshal Ney, though some was subsequently
handed back, &ldquo;because the spoilers feared the
hostility of the <i>Plateros</i>, the silversmiths who live
close to the cathedral, and by whom many workmen
were employed in making little graven
images, teraphims and lares, as well as medallions
of Santiago, which pilgrims purchase.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

874,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and the hideous fourteenth-century reliquary
shaped to represent the head of James Alfeo, and
containing (as it is believed) this very relic (Pl. <a href="#img_57.jpg">viii</a>.).
I make a reservation here, because the Chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
have forbidden the reliquary to be opened. In
either case, whether the head be there or not,
heads of the same apostle are affirmed to be at
Chartres, Toulouse, and other places. Similarly,
discussing these Hydra-headed beings of the Bible
and the hagiology, Villa-amil y Castro (<i>El Tesoro
de la Catedral de Santiago</i>, published in the
<i>Museo Español de Antigüedades</i>) recalls to us the
ten authenticated and indubitable mazzards of
Saint John the Baptist.</p>

<p>The head-shaped reliquary is of beaten silver
with enamelled visage, and the hair and beard gilt.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
The workmanship is French. The cross, which
hung till recently above the altar of the Relicario,
but which now requires to be placed upon the
lengthy list of stolen wealth, was not unlike the
Cross of Angels in the Camara Santa at Oviedo,
and had a wooden body covered with gold plates
in finely executed filigree, studded with precious
stones and cameos. Not many days ago, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
wooden core, divested of the precious metal and
the precious stones, was found abandoned in a field.</p>

<p>Visitors to the shrine of Santiago seldom fail
to have their curiosity excited by the monster
&ldquo;smoke-thrower&rdquo; (<i>bota-fumeiro</i>) or incensory,
lowered (much like the deadly sword in Poe's exciting
tale) on each <i>fiesta</i> by a batch of vigorous
Gallegos from an iron frame fixed into the pendentives
of the dome. &ldquo;The calmest heart,&rdquo; says
Villa-amil, &ldquo;grows agitated to behold this giant
vessel descending from the apex of the nave until
it almost sweeps the ground, wreathed in dense
smoke and spewing flame.&rdquo; Ford seems to have
been unaware that the real purpose of this metal
monster was not to simply scent the holy precincts,
but to cover up the pestilential atmosphere created
by a horde of verminous, diseased, and evil-smelling
pilgrims, who, by a usage which is now suppressed,
were authorized to pass the night before the
services within the actual cathedral wall.</p>

<p>The original <i>bota-fumeiro</i>, resembling, in Oxea's
words, &ldquo;a silver boiler of gigantic bulk,&rdquo; was lost
or stolen in the War of Spanish Independence.
It was replaced by another of iron, and this, in
1851, by the present apparatus of white metal.</p>

<p>Striking objects of ecclesiastical <i>orfebrería</i> were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
produced in Spain throughout the thirteenth and
the fourteenth centuries. Among the finest are the
triptych-reliquary of Seville cathedral known as
the <i>Alfonsine Tables</i>; the <i>retablo</i> and <i>baldaquino</i>
of the cathedral of Gerona; the silver throne,
preserved in Barcelona cathedral, of Don Martin
of Aragon; and the <i>guión</i>, at Toledo, of Cardinal
Mendoza.</p>

<p class="caption">MUDEJAR TRIPTYCH<br />
(<i>Interior of one leaf of the door. 14th Century.<br />
Royal Academy of History, Madrid</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Triptych-reliquaries, which had gradually expanded
from the diptych form&mdash;three leaves or
panels thus replacing two,&mdash;were generally used in
Spain from the eleventh century, and varied in
dimensions from a few inches in height and width
to several yards. We find them in the Gothic,
Mudejar,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Romanic, or Renaissance styles&mdash;wrought
either in a single style of these, or in
effective combination of some two or more. The
Academy of History at Madrid possesses a richly
ornamented Mudejar triptych (Plate <a href="#img_60.jpg">ix</a>.) proceeding
from the Monasterio de Piedra. It is inferior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
notwithstanding, to the <i>Tablas Alfonsinas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> &ldquo;a
specimen of Spanish silversmiths' work which
illustrates the transition to the new style, and the
progress in the design of the figures owing to the
Italian Renaissance.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In or about the year 1274,
this splendid piece of sacred furniture was made
by order of the learned king, to hold the relics of
certain saints and of the Virgin Mary. The
maker is thought by Amador to have been
one &ldquo;Master George,&rdquo; a craftsman held in
high esteem by the father of Alfonso and the
conqueror of Seville, Ferdinand the Third.
Romanic influence is abundant in this triptych,
showing that, although exposed to constant
changes from abroad, the Spanish mediæval
crafts adhered upon the whole with singular
tenacity to primitive tradition.</p>

<p>The triptych is of larch, or some such undecaying
wood, and measures, when the leaves are
opened wide, forty inches over its entire breadth,
by twenty-two in height. Linen is stretched upon
the wood, and over that the silver-gilt <i>repoussé</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
plates which form the principal adornment of the
reliquary. &ldquo;The outside is decorated with twelve
medallions containing the arms of Castile and
Aragon, and forty-eight others in which are
repeated alternately the subjects of the Adoration
of the Magi and the Annunciation of the Virgin,
also in <i>repoussé</i>. In the centres are eagles,
allusive, it is possible, to Don Alfonso's claim
to be crowned Emperor&hellip;. The ornamentation
which surrounds the panels belongs to the
sixteenth century&rdquo; (Riaño). The arms here
spoken of contain the crowned lion and the castle
of three towers; and the interesting fact is pointed
out by Amador that the diminutive doors and
windows of these castles show a strongly pointed
Gothic arch. The sixteenth-century bordering to
the panels is in the manner known as Plateresque.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The clasps are also Plateresque, and prove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
together with the border, that the triptych was
restored about this time.</p>

</div>

<p>Inside (Plate <a href="#img_62.jpg">x</a>.), it consists of fifteen compartments,
&ldquo;full of minute ornamentation, among which
are set a large number of capsules covered with rock
crystal containing relics, each one with an inscription
of enamelled gold, <i>cloisonné</i>. Several good
cameos with sacred subjects appear near the edge
of the side leaves&rdquo; (Riaño). These cameos, handsomely
engraved with figures of the Virgin and
other subjects of religious character, are fairly well
preserved; but the designs upon enamel are almost
obliterated. Eight precious stones, set in as rude
a style as those upon the ancient crowns and
crosses of the Visigoths, have also fallen out, or
been removed, from the interior.</p>

<p>The <i>retablo</i> of Gerona cathedral and its
baldachin date from the fourteenth century.
&ldquo;The Retablo is of wood entirely covered with
silver plates, and divided vertically into three
series of niches and canopies; each division has a
subject, and a good deal of enamelling is introduced
in various parts of the canopies and grounds
of the panels. Each panel has a cinq-foiled arch
with a crocketed gablet and pinnacles on either
side. The straight line of the top is broken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
three niches, which rise in the centre and at either
end. In the centre is the Blessed Virgin with
our Lord; on the right, San Narciso; and on the
left, St Filia. The three tiers of subjects contain
figures of saints, subjects from the life of the
Blessed Virgin, and subjects from the life of our
Lord.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>San Narciso is patron of the city of Gerona;
which explains the presence of his image here.
From the treasury of the same cathedral was
stolen, during the War of Spanish Independence,
a magnificent altar-front of wrought gold and
mosaic, a gift of Countess Gisla, wife of Ramón
Berenguer, count-king of Barcelona. It had in
the centre a bas-relief medallion representing the
Virgin, another medallion with a portrait of the
donor, and various saints in niches, interworked
with precious stones.</p>

<p>The great armchair of Don Martin, called by
Baron Davillier a &ldquo;beau faudesteuil gothique,&rdquo;
which possibly served that monarch as a throne, and
was presented by him to the cathedral of Barcelona,
dates from the year 1410. The wooden frame is
covered with elaborately chiselled plates in silver-gilt.
This most imposing object is carried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

festival of Corpus Christi.</p>

(<i>15th Century. Zaragoza Cathedral</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>guión de Mendoza</i>, now in Toledo cathedral,
is a handsome later-Gothic silver-gilt cross, and is
the same which was raised upon the Torre de la
Vela at Granada on January 2nd, 1492, when the
fairest and most storied city in all Spain surrendered
formally to Ferdinand and Isabella. Many other
interesting crosses, of the character known as processional,
are still preserved in various parts of
the Peninsula, at South Kensington, and elsewhere.
The more remarkable are noticed under
various headings of this book. Their workmanship
is generally of the fifteenth or the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>The Seo or cathedral of Zaragoza possesses a
handsome ship (Plate <a href="#img_65.jpg">xii</a>.), presented to this temple,
towards the end of the fifteenth century, by the
Valencian corsair, Mosén Juan de Torrellas. The
hull is a large shell resting on a silver-gilt dragon of
good design, with a large emerald set in the middle
of its forehead, and a ruby for each eye. Ships of
this kind were not uncommon on a Spanish dining
table of the time, or in the treasuries of churches
and cathedrals. Toledo owns another of these
vessels (in both senses of the word), which once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
belonged to Doña Juana, daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabella.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have confined my notice almost
wholly to the treasure of the Spanish temples.
Turning from ecclesiastical to secular life, we find,
all through the Middle Ages, the humbler classes
kept by constant penury and war aloof from every
form of luxury. Jewellery and gold and silver
work were thus essentially the perquisite or, so to
speak, the privilege of princes, nobles, and the
Church. The mediæval kings and magnates of
this land were smitten inveterately with a passion
for display, and chronicles and inventories of the
time contain instructive details of the quantities of
gems and precious metals employed by them to
decorate their persons and their palaces. The
richness of their bedsteads will be noticed under
Furniture. Quantities of jewellery and plate belonged
to every noble household. For instance, the
testament of the Countess of Castañeda (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1443)
includes the mention of &ldquo;a gilded cup and cover to
the same; a silver vessel and its lid, the edges gilt,
and in the centre of both lid and vessel the arms
of the said count, my lord; a silver vessel with a
foot to it; a diamond ring; a silver vessel with
gilt edges and the arms of the count, companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to the other vessels; a jasper sweetmeat-tray with
silver-gilt handles and feet; four coral spoons; a
gilt enamelled cup and lid; a small gilt cup and
lid; two large silver porringers; two French cups
of white silver; two large plates of eight marks
apiece; two middling-sized silver vessels; two
silver-gilt barrels with silver-gilt chains.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>On each occasion of a court or national festivity,
the apparel of the great was ponderous with gold
and silver fringe, or thickly strewn with pearls&mdash;the
characteristic <i>aljofar</i> or <i>aljofar</i>-work (Arabic
<i>chawar</i>, small pearls), for which the Moors were
widely famed. Towards the thirteenth century
unmarried Spanish women of high rank possessed
abundant stores of bracelets, earrings, necklaces,
gold chains, rings, and gem-embroidered pouches
for their money. Their waist-belts, too, were
heavy with gold and silver, and <i>aljofar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The
poem of the Archpriest of Hita (1343) mentions two
articles of jewellery for female wear called the
<i>broncha</i> and the <i>pancha</i>. The former was an ornament
for the throat; the other, a plate or medal
which hung to below the waist. An Arabic document
quoted by Casiri, and dating from the reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of Henry the First of Castile, specifies as belonging
to an aristocratic lady of that time, &ldquo;Egyptian
shirts of silk and linen, embroidered shirts, Persian
shirts with silk embroidery, Murcian gold necklaces,
ear-pendants of the same metal, set with
gems; finger-rings and bracelets, waist-belts of
skins, embroidered with silk and precious stones;
cloaks of cloth of gold, embroidered mantles of
the same, coverings for the head, and kerchiefs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For all the frequency with which they framed
and iterated sterile and exasperating sumptuary
pragmatics for their people, the Spanish kings
themselves went even beyond the nobles in their
craze for ostentatious luxury. Upon the day when
he was crowned at Burgos, Alfonso the Eleventh
&ldquo;arrayed himself in gold and silver cloth bearing
devices of the castle and the lion, in which was
much <i>aljofar</i>-work, as well as precious stones
innumerable; rubies, emeralds, and sapphires.&rdquo;
Even the bit and saddle of the monarch's charger
were &ldquo;exceeding precious on this day, for gems
and gold and silver covered all the saddle-bows,
and the sides of the saddle and its girths, together
with the headstall, were curiously wrought of gold
and silver thread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similar relations may be found at every moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the history of mediæval Spain. Another instance
may be quoted from the reign of Ferdinand
and Isabella. When these sovereigns visited
Barcelona in 1481, the queen was dressed as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;She advanced riding upon a fine mule,
and seated on cushions covered with brocade,
rising high above the saddle. Her robe was of gold
thread and jewel-work, with a rich brocade skirt.
Upon her head she wore a crown of gold adorned
with richest diamonds, pearls, rubies, balas rubies,
and other stones of passing price.&rdquo; During the
same visit, a royal tournament was given in
the Plaza del Born, in presence of the aristocracy
and wealthy townspeople, &ldquo;the counts, viscounts,
deputies, councillors, <i>caballeros</i>, <i>gentiles hombres</i>,
burgesses, and others without number.&rdquo; Ferdinand,
who &ldquo;with virtue and benignity&rdquo; had
deigned to break a lance or two in tourneying
with the Duke of Alburquerque, the Count of
Benavente, and several gentlemen of Cataluña,
was wearing &ldquo;over his harness a jacket all of gold
brocade. His horse's coverings and poitral also
were of thread of gold, richly devised and wrought,
and of exceeding majesty and beauty. And on
his helm he wore a crown of gold, embellished
with many pearls and other stones; and above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the crown a figure of a large gold bat, which is
the emblem of the kings of Aragon and counts of
Barcelona, with white and sanguine bars upon the
scutcheon.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The queen and the cardinal of Spain
were in a window of the house of Mossen Guillem
Pujades, conservator of the realm of Sicily. Her
highness wore a robe of rich gold thread with a
collar of beautiful pearls; and the trappings of
her mule were of brocade.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Eleven years later the youthful prince, Don Juan,
son of these rulers, appeared before the citizens of
Barcelona dressed in &ldquo;a robe of beautiful brocade
that almost swept the ground, and a doublet of the
same material; the sleeves of the robe thickly
adorned with fine pearls of large size.&rdquo; He carried,
too, &ldquo;a gold collar of great size and beauty, wrought
of large diamonds, pearls, and other stones.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It was an ancient usage with the people of
Barcelona to present a silver service to any
member of the royal family who paid a visit to
their capital. The service so presented to Ferdinand
the Catholic cost the corporation a sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
more than twelve hundred pounds of Catalan
money, and included &ldquo;a saltcellar made upon a
rock. Upon the rock is a castle, the tower of
which contains the salt&hellip;. Two silver ewers,
gilt within and containing on the outside various
enamelled devices in the centre, together with the
city arms. Also a silver-gilt lion upon a rustic
palisade of tree-trunks, holding an inscription in
his right paw, with the arms of the city, a flag,
and a crown upon his head. This object weighs
thirty-four marks.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The service offered on the
same occasion to Isabella, though less in weight,
was more elaborately wrought, and cost on this
account considerably more. It included &ldquo;two
silver ewers, gilt within and enamelled without,
bearing the city arms, and chiselled in the centre
with various designs of foliage. Also a silver
saltcellar, with six small towers, containing at the
foot three pieces of enamel-work with the arms of
the city in relief. This saltcellar has its lid and
case, with a pinnacle upon the lid, and is of silver-gilt
inside and out.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>From about the fifteenth century the goldsmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and the silversmiths of Barcelona enjoyed considerable
fame. Among their names are those of
Lobarolla, Roig, Berni, Belloch, Planes, Mellar,
Corda, Fábregues, Farrán, Perot Ximenis, Rafel
Ximenis, Balagué, and Antonio de Valdés. Riaño
quotes the names of many more from Cean's dictionary.
The most important facts relating to these
artists were brought to light some years ago by
Baron Davillier, who based the greater part of
his research upon the <i>Libros de Pasantía</i> or silversmiths'
examination-books (filled with excellent
designs for jewel-work) of Barcelona. These
volumes, formerly kept in the college of San
Eloy, are now the property of the Provincial
Deputation of this city.</p>

<p>The goldsmiths' and the silversmiths' guild of
Seville also possesses four of its old examination-books,
of which the earliest dates from 1600.
Gestoso, in his <i>Dictionary of Sevillian Artificers</i>
describes the actual ceremony of examination for
a silversmith or goldsmith. Once in every year
the members of the guild assembled in their
chapel of the convent of San Francisco. Here
and upon this day the candidate was closely
questioned, to begin with, as to his &ldquo;purity of
blood&rdquo;&mdash;that is, his freedom from contamination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
by relationship with any Moor or Hebrew.
When it was duly and precisely ascertained that
he, his parents, and his grandparents were uniformly
&ldquo;old Christians,&rdquo; untainted with the
&ldquo;wicked race of Moors, Jews, heretics, mulattoes,
and renegades,&rdquo; and that neither he nor his ancestors
had ever been put on trial by the Inquisition
or by any other tribunal, &ldquo;whether publicly
or secretly,&rdquo; he was permitted to proceed to his
examination proper.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The formula of this was
simple. The candidate was summoned before the
board of examiners, consisting of the Padre Mayor
or patriarch of the guild, and the two <i>veedores</i> or inspectors,
the one of gold-work, the other of silver-work.
The book of drawings was then placed
upon the table, and a ruler was thrust at haphazard
among its leaves. Where the ruler chanced to fall,
the candidate was called upon to execute the corresponding
drawing to the satisfaction of his judges.</p>

<p>Riaño lays too slight a stress upon the Moorish
and Morisco jewellery of Spain. Although the
use of gold and silver ornaments is forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by the Koran, the Muslim, wherever his vanity
or his bodily comfort is involved, tramples his
Bible underfoot almost as regularly, tranquilly,
and radically as the Christians do their own.
The Moors of Spain were not at all behind their
oriental brethren in displaying precious stones
and metals on their persons or about their homes.
Al-Jattib tells us that the third Mohammed
offered to the mosque of the Alhambra columns
with capitals and bases of pure silver. Or who
does not recall the Caliphate of Cordova; the
silver lamp that measured fifty palms across, fitted
with a thousand and fifty-four glass lamplets, and
swinging by a golden chain from the cupola of
the entrance to the <i>mirhab</i> in the vast <i>mezquita</i>;
the silver candlesticks and perfume-burners in the
same extraordinary temple; the precious stones
and metals employed in mighty quantities to decorate
the palaces of Az-zahyra and Az-zahra?&mdash;</p>

<p>In brief, just as the prelates of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Church habitually precede the Christian laity in
trampling underfoot the elemental doctrine of Our
Lord, so were the most exalted and responsible
of all the Mussulmans&mdash;that is, their sultans&mdash;indefatigably
foremost in neglect of the Koranic
law.</p>

<p>The Spanish sultans wore a ring of gold containing
one large stone (such as an emerald, or
ruby, or turquoise), on which was cut the royal
seal and signature. Such was the ring belonging
to Boabdil el Chico, worn by him on the very
day of the surrender of his capital, and by his hand
presented to a Spanish nobleman, the Count of
Tendilla, governor-elect of the Alhambra. According
to Rodriguez de Ardila, the following
inscription was upon the stone:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>La Ala ile
Ala, abahu Tabiu. Aben Abi Abdalá</i>,&rdquo; meaning,
&ldquo;<i>There is no God but God; this is the seal
of Aben Abi Abdalá.</i>&rdquo; Ardila, who was the
author of a history of the Counts of Tendilla
(which still remains in manuscript), adds that he
saw the ring, although, as Eguilaz observes,
two words of the inscription are inaccurately
rendered.</p>

<p>Among the Moors of Spain the use of signet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
rings was general. The stone employed was
commonly cornelian, richly mounted and inscribed
in various ways, as with the owner's name, his
name together with a date, or the name of the
town of which he was a native. In other instances
we meet with pious phrases or quotations from
the Koran; or perhaps a talismanic figure, such
as the open eye to guard the wearer from the

Granada.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly, too, the Moorish sultans of this
country owned enormous hoards of silver, gold,
and precious stones. Al-Makkari says that the
treasure of the Nasrite rulers of Granada included
quantities of pearls, turquoises, and rubies;
pearl necklets; earrings &ldquo;surpassing those of
Mary the Copt&rdquo; (Mohammed's concubine); swords
of the finest temper, embellished with pure gold;
helmets with gilded borders, studded with emeralds,
pearls, and rubies; and silvered and enamelled
belts.</p>

<p>The Moorish women of this country, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
particular the Granadinas,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> were passionately fond
of jewellery. Ornaments which once belonged to
them are sometimes brought to light in Andalusia,
Murcia, or Valencia, including pendants,
rings, necklaces, and <i>axorcas</i> or bangles for the
ankle or the wrist, and bracelets for the upper
portion of the arm. The National Museum contains
a small collection of these objects, dating from
the time of the Moriscos, and including a handsome
necklace terminating in a double chain, with ball
and pyramid shaped ornaments about the centre,
a square-headed finger-ring with four green stones
and a garnet, and a hollow bracelet filled with a
substance that appears to be mastic, similar to
those which are reproduced in Plate xiii.</p>

<p>These jewels, I repeat, are of Morisco workmanship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and therefore date from later than the
independent empire of the Spanish Moors.
Nevertheless, the geometrical or filigree design
was common both to Moorish and Morisco art.
As I observed in my description of the casket-reliquaries,
we note continually the influence of
these motives on the arts of Christian Spain.
The Ordinances relative to the goldsmiths and the
silversmiths of Granada, cried at various times
between 1529 and 1538, whether &ldquo;in the silversmiths'
street of the Alcaycería, that has its
opening over against the scriveners'&rdquo;; or in &ldquo;the
street of the Puente del Carbon, before the goldsmiths'
shops&rdquo;; or &ldquo;in the street of the Zacatin,
where dwell the silversmiths,&rdquo; prove also that for
many years after the Reconquest the character
and nomenclature of this kind of work continued
to be principally and traditionally Moorish.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Ordinances complain that the
goldsmiths of Granada now employ a base
and detrimental standard of the precious metals,
especially in the bracelets or <i>manillas</i> of the
women. The goldsmiths answer in their vindication
that equally as poor a standard is employed at
Seville, Cordova, and Toledo. These city laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
herewith establish twenty carats as a minimum
fineness for the gold employed in making ornaments.
The makers, also, are ordered to impress
their private stamp or seal on every article, or in
default to pay a fine of ten thousand <i>maravedis</i>. A
copy of each stamp or seal to be deposited in the
city chest. The <i>alamín</i> or inspector of this trade
to test and weigh all gold and silver work before
it is exposed for sale.</p>

<p>We learn from the same source that the gold
bracelets were sometimes smooth, and sometimes
&ldquo;covered over with devices&rdquo; (<i>cubiertos de estampas
por cima</i>). The technical name of these was
<i>albordados</i>. The silver bracelets were also either
smooth, or stamped, or twisted in a cord (<i>encordados</i>).
Bangles for the ankle, upper arm, and
wrist are mentioned as continuing to be generally
worn, while one of the Ordinances complains that
&ldquo;Moorish <i>axorcas</i> are often sold that are hollow,
and filled with chalk and mastic, so that before
they can be weighed it is necessary to rid them
of such substances by submitting them to fire,
albeit the fire turns them black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weapons and war-harness of the Spanish
Moors were often exquisitely decorated with the
precious stones or metals. Splendid objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
this kind have been preserved, and will be noticed
in their proper chapter.</p>

<p>The ruinous and reckless measure known to
Spain's eternal shame as the Expulsion of the
Moriscos, deprived this country of a great&mdash;perhaps
the greatest&mdash;part of her resources.
Fonseca estimates this loss, solely in the quantity
of coin conveyed away, at two million and eight
hundred thousand <i>escudos</i>, adding that a single
Morisco, Alami Delascar de Aberique, bore off
with him one hundred thousand ducats.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> To
make this matter worse, the Moriscos, just before
they went on board their ships, fashioned from
scraps of tin, old nails, and other refuse, enormous
stores of counterfeit coin, and slyly sold
this rubbish to the simple Spaniards in return
for lawful money of the land. In the course of
a few days, and in a single quarter of Valencia,
more than three hundred thousand ducats of false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
coin were thus passed off upon the Christians.
Besides this exportation of good Spanish money,
the cunning fugitives removed huge quantities
of jewellery and plate. Chains, <i>axorcas</i>, rings,
<i>zarcillos</i>, and gold <i>escudos</i> were taken from the
bodies of many of the Morisco women who were
murdered by the Spanish soldiery; but the greater
part of all this treasure found its way to Africa.
In his work <i>Expulsión justificada de los Moriscos</i>
(1612), Aznar de Cardona says that the Morisco
women carried &ldquo;divers plates upon the breast,
together with necklaces and collars, earrings and
bracelets.&rdquo; It is recorded, too, that the Moriscos,
as they struggled in the country regions to avenge
themselves upon their persecutors, did unlimited
damage to the ornaments and fittings of the
churches. &ldquo;This people,&rdquo; says Fonseca, &ldquo;respected
not our temples or the holy images
that in them were; nor yet the chalices and
other objects they encountered in our sacristies.
Upon the contrary, they smashed the crosses,
burned the saints, profaned the sacred vestments,
and committed such acts of sacrilege as
though they had been Algerian Moors, or Turks
of Constantinople.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Legends of hidden Moorish and Morisco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wealth are still extant in many parts of Spain.
The Abbé Bertaut de Rouen<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and Swinburne
among foreigners, or Spaniards such as the gossiping
priest Echeverría, who provided Washington
Irving with the pick of his <i>Tales of the Alhambra</i>,
have treated copiously of this fascinating and
mysterious theme. The Siete Suelos Tower at
Granada is particularly favoured with traditions of
this kind. Peasants of the Alpujarras still declare
that piles of Moorish money lie secreted in the
lofty buttresses of Mulhacen and the Veleta, while
yet another summit of this snowy range bears the
suggestive title of the Cerro del Tesoro, where,
almost within the memory of living men, a
numerous party, fitted and commissioned by the
State, explored with feverish though unlucky zeal
the naked cliffs and sterile crannies of the lonely
mountain.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Reducing all these fables to the terms of truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Moorish and Morisco jewellery and coin are sometimes
brought to light on Spanish soil. Such
finds occur, less seldom than elsewhere, within
the provinces of Seville, Cordova, Granada, and
Almeria (Plate <a href="#img_83.jpg">xiv</a>.), but since they are neither
frequent nor considerable, although the likeliest
ground for them is being disturbed continually,
we may conclude that nearly all the Muslim
wealth accumulated here slipped from the clumsy
if ferocious fingers of the mother-country, and
found its way, concealed upon the bodies of her
persecuted offspring, to the shores of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes, too, an early gold or silver object
would be melted down and modernized into
another and a newer piece of plate. This was a
fairly common usage with the silversmiths themselves,
or with an ignorant or stingy brotherhood
or chapter. Thus, the following entry occurs in
the <i>Libro de Visita de Fábrica</i> belonging to the
parish church of Santa Ana, Triana, Seville. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the year 1599 &ldquo;the large cross of silver-gilt,
together with its <i>mançana</i> and all the silver attaching
thereto, was taken to the house of Zubieta the
silversmith, and pulled to pieces. It weighed 25
marks and 4 <i>ochavas</i> of silver, besides 5 marks and
2 ounces and 4 <i>ochavas</i> of silver which was the
weight of the three lamps delivered to Zubieta in
the time of Juan de Mirando, aforetime steward
of this church. It is now made into a silver-gilt
cross.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>A similar instance may be quoted from a
document of Cordova, published by Ramírez de
Arellano in his relation of a visit to the monastery
of San Jerónimo de Valparaiso. In the year
1607 Gerónimo de la Cruz, a Cordovese silversmith,
agreed with the prior of this monastery to
make for the community a silver-gilt <i>custodia</i>. For
this purpose he received from the prior, doubtless
a man of parsimonious spirit and a boor in his
appreciativeness of art, eight pairs of vinegar
cruets, four of whose tops were missing; a silver-gilt
chalice and its patine; a <i>viril</i> with two angels
and four pieces on the crown of it; a small
communion cup; some silver candlesticks; four
spoons and a fork, also of silver; and a silver-gilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
salt-cellar. The total value of these objects was 1826
<i>reales</i>; and all of them were tossed, in Ford's indignant
phrase, into the &ldquo;sacrilegious melting-pot,&rdquo;
in order to provide material for the new <i>custodia</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The gold and silver work of Christian Spain
attained, throughout the fifteenth and the sixteenth
centuries, a high degree of excellence
(Plates <a href="#img_85.jpg">xv</a>., <a href="#img_95.jpg">xvi</a>., etc.). The best of it was
made at Seville, Barcelona, Toledo, and Valladolid.
Objects of great artistic worth were also
produced at Burgos, Palencia, León, Cuenca,
Cordova, and Salamanca. I have already mentioned
some of the principal <i>orfebreros</i> of Barcelona.
Juan Ruiz of Cordova, whom Juan de Arfe applauds
as &ldquo;the first silversmith who taught the way to do
good work in Andalusia,&rdquo; was also, in this region,
the first to turn the precious metals on the lathe.
A famous silversmith of Seville was Diego de
Vozmediano, whom we find living there in 1525.
Toledo, too, could boast, among an army of distinguished
gold and silver smiths (Riaño gives the
names of no fewer than seventy-seven), Cristóbal
de Ordas, Juan Rodríguez de Babria, and Pedro
Hernandez, <i>plateros</i>, respectively, to Charles the
Fifth, to Philip the Second, and to the queen-dowager
of Portugal; and also the silversmith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and engraver upon metals, Pedro Angel, whose
praise is sung by Lope de Vega in the prologue to
his <i>auto</i> called <i>The Voyage of the Soul</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">&ldquo;<i>Y es hoy Pedro Angel un divino artífice<br />
con el buril en oro, plata, ó cobre.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>By far the greater part of all Toledo's gold and
silver work was made for service in her mighty
temple. Such were the statue of Saint Helen,
presented by Philip the Second; the crown of
the Virgen del Sagrario, wrought by Hernando de
Carrión and Alejo de Montoya; the bracelets or
<i>ajorcas</i> made for the image of the same Madonna
by Julián Honrado; and the exquisite chests
carved in 1569 and 1598 by Francisco Merino
from designs by the two Vergaras, father and son,
as reliquaries for the bones of San Eugenio and
Santa Leocadia, patrons of this ancient capital.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
A magnificent silver lamp was also, in 1565, offered
by the chapter of the cathedral to the church of
Saint Denis in France, in gratitude for the surrender
of the bones of San Eugenio to the city of
his birth. These and other objects of Toledan
gold and silver work are stated to be &ldquo;worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
comparison with the very best of what was then
produced in Germany, Italy, and France.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Baron Davillier also held a high opinion of the
Spanish <i>orfebreros</i> of this time. After remarking
that the Italian influence was powerful among the
Spaniards in the sixteenth century, and more particularly
for some fifty years at Barcelona, he says:
&ldquo;A cette époque les <i>plateros</i> espagnols pouvaient
rivaliser sans désavantage avec les Italiens, les
Français, les Flamands, et les Allemands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same authority also says that the Spanish
<i>plateros</i> of this period were skilled enamellers on
gold and silver, and quotes some entries from
French inventories of the time in which we read
of cups, salt-cellars, washing-basins, and other
objects executed or enamelled &ldquo;à la mode
d'Espagne.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>As we have seen, the exodus of the Moriscos
lost to Spain a great proportion of her total wealth,
although, conjointly with this loss, new wealth
flowed into her in marvellous abundance from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
New World.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Thus, the silver-mines of Potosi,
discovered in 1545, sent over to the mother-country,
between that year and 1633, no less than eight
hundred and forty-five millions of <i>pesos</i>. And yet
this mighty influx of new riches cannot be said,
except in the artistic sense, to have enriched the
nation. She had renounced the service of the
most industrious and, in many instances, the most
ingenious of her native craftsmen; while on the
other hand the Christians, with but limited exceptions,
were far too proud and far too indolent to
set their hand to any form of manual exercise;
just as (I much regret to add) a great proportion of
them are this very day. Foreign artificers in consequence
(particularly after the royal pragmatic
of 1623 encouraging their immigration), attracted
by the treasure fleets that anchored in the bay of
Cadiz, came trooping into Spain and filled their
pockets from the national purse, fashioning, in
return for money which they husbanded and sent
abroad, luxurious gold and silver objects that were
merely destined to stagnate within her churches
and cathedrals.</p>

<p>Riaño and Baron de la Vega de Hoz extract
from Cean Bermudez a copious list of silversmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
who worked in Spain all through the Middle
Ages. This long array of isolated names and
dates is neither interesting nor informative.
Newer and more attractive notices have been
discovered subsequently. Thus, in the National
Library at Madrid, Don Manuel G. Simancas has
disinterred quite recently the copy made by a
Jesuit of a series of thirteenth-century accounts
relating to various craftsmen of the reign of
Sancho the Fourth (&ldquo;the Brave&rdquo;). Two of them
are concerning early <i>orfebreros</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juan Yanez. By letters of the king and
queen to Johan Yanez, goldsmith, brother of
Ferran García, scrivener to the king; for three
chalices received from him by the king,
<span class="smcap">CCCCLXXVIII</span> <i>maravedis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second entry says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bartolomé Rinalt. And he paid Bartolomé
Rinalt for jewels which the queen bought from
him to present to Doña Marina Suarez, nurse of
the Infante Don Pedro, MCCCL <i>maravedis</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Among Spain's gold and silver craftsmen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the fifteenth century we find the names of Juan
de Castelnou, together with his son Jaime, who
worked at Valencia; of Lope Rodríguez de
Villareal, Ruby, and Juan Gonzalez, all three of
whom worked at Toledo; and of Juan de Segovia,
a friar of Guadalupe. Papers concerning Juan
Gonzalez, and dated 1425, 1427, and 1431, are
published among the <i>Documentos Inéditos</i> of
Zarco del Valle. One of Segovia's masterpieces
was a silver salt-cellar in the form of a lion tearing
open a pomegranate&mdash;clearly allusive to the conquest
of Granada from the Moors. Upon their
visiting the monastery, Ferdinand and Isabella
saw and, as was natural, conceived a fancy for
this salt-cellar; and so, whether from inclination
or necessity, the brotherhood induced them to
accept it.</p>

<p>Sixteenth-century <i>plateros</i> of renown were Juan
Donante, Mateo and Nicolás (whose surnames
are unknown)&mdash;all three of whom worked at
Seville; and Duarte Rodríguez and Fernando
Ballesteros, natives of that city. In or about the
year 1524 were working at Toledo the silversmiths
Pedro Herreros and Hernando de Valles,
together with Diego Vazquez, Andres Ordoñez,
Hernando de Carrión, Diego de Valdivieso, Juan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Domingo de Villanueva, Diego Abedo de Villandrando,
Juan Tello de Morata, Francisco de
Reinalte, Hans Belta, and Francisco Merino.
Several of these men were natives of Toledo.</p>

<p>Among the silversmiths of sixteenth-century
Cordova were Diego de Alfaro and his son Francisco,
Francisco de Baena, Alonso Casas, Alonso del
Castillo, Luis de Cordoba, Sebastián de Cordoba,
Cristóbal de Escalante, Juan Gonzalez, Diego
Fernandez, Diego Hernandez Rubio (son of
Sebastián de Cordoba), Rodrigo de León, Gómez
Luque, Ginés Martinez, Melchor de los Reyes
(silversmith and enameller), Andrés de Roa,
Pedro de Roa, Alonso Sanchez, Jerónimo Sanchez
de la Cruz, Martin Sanchez de la Cruz (Jerónimo's
son), Pedro Sanchez de Luque, Alonso de Sevilla,
Juan Urbano, and Lucas de Valdés.</p>

<p>Not much is told us of the lives and labours of
these artists. The best reputed of them as a
craftsman was Rodrigo de León, who stood next
after Juan Ruiz, <i>el Sandolino</i>. Ramírez de
Arellano, from whom I have collected these data,
publishes a number of León's agreements or
contracts, which from their length and dryness I
do not here repeat. In 1603 we find him official
silversmith to the cathedral, under the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>platero de martillo</i> (&ldquo;silversmith of hammered
work&rdquo;) <i>de la obra de la catedral desta ciudad</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Francisco de Alfaro, although a Cordovese by
birth, resided commonly at Seville. In 1578 he
received 446,163 <i>maravedis</i> for making four silver
candlesticks for use in celebrating divine service.
These candlesticks are still in the cathedral.</p>

<p>Sebastián de Cordoba was one of the foremost
artists of his age. He died in 1587, leaving,
together with other children, a son, Diego, who
also won some reputation as a silversmith.
Ramírez de Arellano publishes a full relation
of the property which Sebastián de Cordoba
bequeathed at his decease, as well as of the money
which was owing to him. Among the former, or
the &ldquo;movable effects,&rdquo; we read of &ldquo;Isabel, a
Morisco woman, native of the kingdom of Granada;
her age thirty-four years, a little less or more.&rdquo;
The same inventory includes a curious and
complete account of all the tools and apparatus in
Sebastián's workshop.</p>

<p>But the quaintest notice of them all, though it
does not apprise us of his merit as a silversmith,
is that concerning Cristóbal de Escalante.
Cristóbal suffered, we are told, from &ldquo;certain sores
produced by humours in his left leg; wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the said leg undergoes a change and swells.&rdquo; He
therefore makes a contract with one Juan Jiménez,
&ldquo;servant in the Royal Stables of His Majesty
the King,&rdquo; and duly examined as a herbalist
(&ldquo;licensed,&rdquo; in the actual phrase, &ldquo;to remedy this
kind of ailments&rdquo;), who is to heal his leg &ldquo;by
means of the divine will of the cure.&rdquo; As soon as
Cristóbal shall be thoroughly well, &ldquo;in so much
that his ailing leg shall be the other's equal in the
fatness and the form thereof,&rdquo; he is to pay Jiménez
five-and-fifty <i>reales</i>, &ldquo;having already given him ten
<i>reales</i> on account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably, as Señor Ramírez de Arellano facetiously
supposes, Cristóbal, after such a course of
treatment, would be lame for all his life. At
any rate, he died in 1605, though whether from
the gentle handling of the stableman and herbalist
is not recorded in these entries.</p>

<p>Still keeping to the sixteenth century, in other
parts of Spain we find the silversmiths Baltasar
Alvarez and Juan de Benavente, working at Palencia;
Alonso de Dueñas at Salamanca; and
Juan de Orna at Burgos, about the same time that
the foreigners Jacomi de Trezzo and Leo Leoni
were engaged at the Escorial. Cuenca, too,
boasted three excellent silver-workers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
family of Becerril, mentioned by Juan de Arfe in
company with other craftsmen of the time of the
Renaissance.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Stirling says of Cuenca and the
Becerriles: &ldquo;They made for the cathedral its
great <i>custodia</i>, which was one of the most costly
and celebrated pieces of church plate in Spain.
They began it in 1528, and, though ready for use
in 1546, it was not finished till 1573. It was a
three-storied edifice, of a florid classical design,
crowned with a dome, and enriched with numberless
groups and statues, and an inner shrine of
jewelled gold; it contained 616 marks of silver,
and cost 17,725&frac12; ducats, a sum which can barely
have paid the ingenious artists for the labour of
forty-five years. In the War of Independence,
this splendid prize fell into the hands of the
French General Caulaincourt, by whom it was
forthwith turned into five-franc pieces, bearing the
image and superscription of Napoleon.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>A more reliable notice says that this <i>custodia</i>
was begun by Alonso Becerril and finished by
his brother Francisco. The third member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
this family of artists, Cristóbal, who flourished
towards the end of the sixteenth century, was
Francisco's son.</p>

<p class="caption">GOTHIC <i>CUSTODIA</i><br />
(<i>15th Century</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Towards the close of the Gothic and during the
earlier phases of the Renaissance movement in
this country, enormous quantities of gold and
silver began to be employed in making these
<i>custodias</i> or monstrances of her temples; so that
the fifteenth century may well be called, in
Spanish craftsmanship, the &ldquo;age of the <i>custodia</i>.&rdquo;
A century ago the reverend Townsend, loyal to
the Low Church prejudices of his day, spoke of
this object with something of a sneer as &ldquo;the
depository of the Host, or, according to the ideas
of a Catholic, the throne of the Most High, when,
upon solemn festivals, He appears to command
the adoration of mankind.&rdquo; Riaño's description is
more technical. &ldquo;The name of <i>custodia</i>,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;is given in Spain, not only to the monstrance
or ostensoir where the Blessed Sacrament is
exposed, but also to a sort of temple or tabernacle,
of large size, made also of silver, inside which
is placed the monstrance, which is carried in procession
on Corpus Christi day (Plate <a href="#img_95.jpg">xvi</a>.). In
order to distinguish these objects one from another,
the name of <i>viril</i> is given to the object which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
holds the consecrated Host; it is generally made
of rock crystal, with a gold stem and mount
ornamented with precious stones. The small
tabernacles are generally objects of the greatest
importance, both from their artistic and intrinsic
value.&rdquo; A third description of the monstrance,
written in quaint and antiquated Spanish verse
by Juan de Arfe, is truthfully if not melodiously
translated into English rhyme by Stirling:&mdash;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the monstrance of Toledo,
surmounted by a cross of solid gold, turns the
scale at ten thousand nine hundred ounces, and
that of Avila at one hundred and forty pounds,
the weight of nearly all of these <i>custodias</i> is far exceeded
by the value of their workmanship. The
style employed in their construction is the Gothic,
the Renaissance, or the two combined. <i>Custodias</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of the eastern parts of Spain are more affected
than the others by Italian influence, noticeable
both in decorative motives which recall the
Florentine, and in the use, together with the
silver-work, of painting and enamels. In other
parts of Spain the dominating influence is the
later Gothic. Among the former or Levantine
class of monstrances, the most important are those
of Barcelona, Vich, Gerona, and Palma de Mallorca;
and of the others, those of Cordova, Cadiz,
Sahagún, Zamora, Salamanca, and Toledo&mdash;this
last, according to Bertaut de Rouen, &ldquo;à la
manière d'un clocher percé à jour, d'ouvrage de
filigrane, et plein de figures.&rdquo; <i>Custodias</i> in the
purest classic or Renaissance style are those of
Seville, Valladolid, Palencia, Avila, Jaen, Madrid,
Segovia, Zaragoza, Santiago, and Orense.</p>

<p>Juan de Arfe y Villafañe, who may be called
the Cellini of Spain's <i>custodia</i>-makers, was born
at León in 1535. He was the son of Antonio de
Arfe, and grandson of Enrique de Arfe, a German
who had married a Spanish wife and made his
home in Spain. The family of Juan, including
his brother Antonio, were all distinguished craftsmen,
and he himself informs us that his grandfather
excelled in Gothic <i>platería</i>, as may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
judged from the <i>custodias</i>, by Enrique's hand, of
Cordova, León, Toledo, and Sahagún, and many
smaller objects, such as incensories, crosiers, and
paxes.</p>

<p>The father of Juan, Antonio de Arfe, worked
in silver in the Renaissance or Plateresque styles,
and executed in the florid manner the <i>custodias</i> of
Santiago de Galicia and Medina de Rioseco; but
the training and tastes of Juan himself were sternly
classical. His work in consequence has a certain
coldness, largely atoned for by its exquisite correctness
of design and unimpeachable proportions.
Arfe's ideal in these matters may readily be judged
of from his written verdict on the Greco-Roman
architecture. &ldquo;The Escorial,&rdquo; he says, in the
preface to his description of the <i>custodia</i> of Seville
cathedral, &ldquo;<i>because it follows the rules of ancient
art</i>, competes in general perfection, size, or splendour
with the most distinguished buildings of
the Asiatics, Greeks, and Romans, and displays
magnificence and truth in all its detail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In point of versatility Juan de Arfe was a kind
of Spanish Leonardo. His book, <i>De Varia Conmensuración</i>,
etc., published in 1585, is divided
into four parts, and deals, the first part with the
practice of geometry, the second with human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
anatomy, the third with animals, and the fourth
with architecture and silver-work for use in
churches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        title="IOAN DE ARFE" />
        <a name="img_99.jpg" id="img_99.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>This book is prefaced by the portrait of the
author, given above. It shows us&mdash;what he
really was&mdash;a quiet, cultured, gentle-hearted
man. Indeed, while Arfe was studying anatomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
at Salamanca, it gave him pain to lacerate the
bodies even of the dead. &ldquo;I was witness,&rdquo; he
records, &ldquo;to the flaying of several pauper men
and women whom the law had executed; but
these experiments, besides being horrible and
cruel, I saw to be of little service to my studies
in anatomy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arfe's workmanship of the <i>custodia</i> of Avila
cathedral, which he began in 1564 and terminated
in 1571, won for him an early and extended fame.
He also made the <i>custodia</i> of Burgos (brutally
melted during the Spanish War of Independence),
and those of Valladolid (finished in 1590), Lugo,
Osma, and the Hermandad del Santísimo at
Madrid. The <i>custodia</i> of Palencia is also thought
by some to be his handiwork.</p>

<p>But Arfe's crowning labour was the Greco-Roman
<i>custodia</i> of Seville cathedral (Plate <a href="#img_100.jpg">xvii</a>.).
The chapter of this temple selected his design in
1580, and nominated the licentiate Pacheco to assist
him with the statuettes. Pacheco also carried out
his portion of the task with skill and judgment. A
rare pamphlet, written by Arfe and published at
Seville in 1587, gives a minute description of the
whole <i>custodia</i>. In Appendix C, I render this
description into English, together with a similarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
detailed notice of the <i>custodia</i> (1513 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) of
Cordova. This last, which we have seen to be
the work of Juan de Arfe's grandfather, Enrique,
is not to be surpassed for fairy grace and lightness,
seeming, in the eloquent metaphor of a modern
writer, &ldquo;to have been conceived in a dream, and
executed with the breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>CUSTODIA</i> OF SEVILLE CATHEDRAL<br />
(<i>By Juan de Arfe. Late 16th Century</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Spain in the seventeenth century had reached
the lowest depth of her decadence and impoverishment;
and yet we find that century an age&mdash;to
quote a Spanish term&mdash;of &ldquo;gallantries and pearls,&rdquo;
in which a craze for reckless luxury continued to
prevail in every quarter. Narratives innumerable
inform us of the life and doings of that prodigal
court and prodigal aristocracy; their ruinous and
incessant festivals; the fortunes that were thrown
away on furniture, and jewels, and costume. True,
we are told by Bertaut de Rouen that, except
upon their numerous holidays, the costume of the
Spanish men was plain enough. This author, who
calls them otherwise &ldquo;debauched and ignorant,&rdquo;
says that their clothes were all of &ldquo;méchante frise,&rdquo;
and adds that they continually took snuff, &ldquo;dont
ils ont toujours les narines pleines, ce qui fait qu'ils
n'ont que des mouchoirs de laine, de toile grise, et
peinte comme de la toile de la Chine.&rdquo; The same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
traveller, attending an ordinary reception in the
royal palace at Madrid, was unable to distinguish
the nobles from the lower orders, except that, by
the privilege peculiar to this country, the former
kept their hats on in the presence of the sovereign.
Even of Philip himself he says: &ldquo;Le Roy d'Espagne
estoit debout avec un habit fort simple et fort
ressemblant à tous ses portraits&rdquo;; alluding, probably,
to those of Philip the Fourth by Velazquez,
in which the monarch wears a plain cloth
doublet.</p>

<p>But when the Spaniard dressed himself for any
scene of gala show, his spendthrift inclinations
swelled into a positive disease. The women, too,
squandered enormous sums on finery. The
Marchioness of Liche, said to have been the
loveliest Española of that day, is spoken of by
Bertaut as wearing &ldquo;un corps de brocard d'argent
avec de grandes basques à leur mode, la jupe
d'une autre étoffe avec grand nombre de pierreries,
et cela luy fetoit fort bien.&rdquo; An anonymous
manuscript of the period, published by Gayangos
in the <i>Revista de España</i> for 1884, describes the
<i>fiestas</i> celebrated at Valladolid in 1605, in honour
of the English ambassador and his retinue. In
this relation the Duke of Lerma is quoted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
possessing a yearly income of three hundred
thousand <i>cruzados</i>, besides &ldquo;as much again in
jewellery and furniture, and gold and silver services.&rdquo;
At the state banquets which were given
at that wasteful court, even the pies and tarts
were washed with gold or silver; and at a single
feast the dishes of various kinds of fare amounted
to two thousand and two hundred. At the banquet
given by the Duke of Lerma, three special
sideboards were constructed to sustain the weight
of four hundred pieces of silver, &ldquo;all of them of
delicate design and exquisitely wrought of silver,
gold, and enamel, together with innumerable objects
of glass and crystal of capricious form, with
handles, lids, and feet of finest gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole of Spain's nobility was congregated
at these festivals, &ldquo;richly attired with quantities
of pearls and oriental gems,&rdquo; while everybody,
young and old alike, wore &ldquo;diamond buttons and
brooches on cloaks and doublets,&rdquo; feather plumes
with costly medals, gold chains with emeralds,
and other ornaments. The ladies of the aristocracy
were also &ldquo;clothed in costliest style, as
well as loaded with diamonds and pearls and
hair-ornaments of pearls and gold, such as the
women of Castile lay by for these solemnities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spanish churches, too, continued to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
veritable storehouses of treasure. The manuscript
published by Gayangos says that in 1605 the
church of La Merced at Valladolid had its altars
&ldquo;covered with beautiful gold and silver vessels,
of which there are a great many in the whole of
Castilla la Vieja, and particularly here at Valladolid.&rdquo;
Bertaut de Rouen's notice of the shrine
of Montserrat in Cataluña has been inserted
previously. In 1775 Swinburne wrote of the
same temple:&mdash;&ldquo;In the sacristy and passages
leading to it are presses and cupboards full of
relics and ornaments of gold, silver, and precious
stones; they pointed out to us, as the most remarkable,
two crowns for the Virgin and her Son,
of inestimable value, some large diamond rings,
an excellent cameo of Medusa's head, the Roman
emperors in alabaster, the sword of Saint Ignatius,
and the chest that contains the ashes of a famous
brother, John Guarin, of whom they relate the
same story as that given in the <i>Spectator</i> of a
Turkish santon and the Sultan's daughter&hellip;.
Immense is the quantity of votive offerings to this
miraculous statue; and as nothing can be rejected
or otherwise disposed of, the shelves are crowded
with the most whimsical <i>ex votos</i>, viz., silver legs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fingers, breasts, earrings, watches, two-wheeled
chaises, boats, carts, and such-like trumpery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many pragmatics from the Crown vainly
endeavoured to suppress or mitigate the popular
extravagance. Such was the royal letter of 1611,
which forbade, among the laity, the wearing of
&ldquo;gold jewels with decoration or enamel in relief,
or points with pearls or other stones.&rdquo; Smaller
jewels, of the kind known as <i>joyeles</i> and <i>brincos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
were limited to a single stone, together with its
pearl pendant. The jewellery of the women was
exempted from these laws, though even here were
certain limitations. Rings for the finger might,
however, bear enamel-work, or any kind of stone.
Enamel was also allowed in gold buttons and
chains for the men's caps, as well as in the badges
worn by the knights of the military orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is forbidden,&rdquo; continues this pragmatic, &ldquo;to
make any object of gold, silver, or other metal
with work in relief, or the likeness of a person;
nor shall any object be gilt, excepting drinking
vessels, and the weight of these shall not exceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
three marks. All other silver shall be flat and
plain, without gilding; but this does not apply to
objects intended for religious worship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All niello-work is prohibited, as are silver
brasiers and buffets.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>What I may call the private jewel-work of
Spain, largely retains throughout its history the
characteristic lack of finish of all the Visigothic
treasure found at Guarrazar. From first to last,
until extinguished or absorbed by foreign influences
two centuries ago, it strives to compensate in
ponderous and bulky splendour for what it lacks
in delicacy, elegance, and taste. It is just the
jewellery we should expect to find among a military
people who once upon a time possessed great
riches simultaneously with little education, and
who, from this and other causes, such as the
strenuous opposition of the national church to
pagan sentiments expressed in fleshly form, were
never genuinely or profoundly art-loving. Long
residence and observation in their midst induce
me to affirm that as a race the Spaniards are and
always have been hostile, or at least indifferent, to
the arts; and that their most illustrious artists
have made their power manifest and raised themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to eminence despite the people&mdash;not, as in
Italy, on the supporting shoulders of the people.</p>

<p>Dazzle and show monopolized, and to a great
extent monopolize still, the preference of this
race. The Spanish breast-ornaments of the
seventeenth century, preserved at South Kensington
and reproduced by Riaño on pages 37 and 39
of his handbook, are strongly reminiscent of the
Visigothic ornaments. Who would imagine that
a thousand years had come and gone between the
execution of the new and of the old? As late as
the reign of Charles the Second the culture of a
Spanish lady of high birth was little, if at all,
superior to a savage's. &ldquo;False stones enchant
them,&rdquo; wrote Countess d'Aulnoy. &ldquo;Although
they possess many jewels of considerable value
and the finest quality, it is their whim to carry on
their person wretched bits of glass cut in the
coarsest fashion, just like those which pedlars in
my country sell to country girls who have seen
nobody but the village curate, and nothing but
their flocks of sheep. Dames of the aristocracy
adorn themselves with these pieces of glass, that
are worth nothing at all; yet they purchase them
at high prices. When I asked them why they
like false diamonds, they told me they prefer them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to the genuine as being larger. Indeed, they
sometimes wear them of the bigness of an egg.&rdquo;
Even where the stones were real, the Spanish
taste in setting and in wearing them was no less
execrable. The Countess says: &ldquo;the ladies here
possess great stores of beautiful precious stones,
and do not wear, like Frenchwomen, a single
article of jewellery, but nine or ten together, some
of diamonds, others of rubies, pearls, emeralds,
and turquoises, wretchedly mounted, since they are
almost wholly covered with the gold. When I
inquired the cause of this, they told me the jewels
were so made because the gold was as beautiful
as the gems. I suppose, however, the real reason
is the backwardness of the craftsmen, who can do
no better work than this, excepting Verbec, who
has no lack of skill, and would turn out excellent
jewels if he took the trouble to finish them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the neck of their bodices the ladies fasten
pins profusely set with precious stones. Hanging
from the pin, and fastened at the lower end to
the side of their dress, is a string of pearls or
diamonds. They wear no necklace, but bracelets
on their wrists and rings on their fingers, as well
as long earrings of so great a weight that I know
not how they can support them. Hanging from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
these earrings they display whatever finery they
may fancy. I have seen some ladies who wore
good-sized watches hanging from their ears, strings
of precious stones, English keys of dainty make,
and little bells. They also wear the <i>agnus</i>, together
with little images about their neck and
arms, or in their hair. They dress their hair in
various ways, and always go with it uncovered,
using many hairpins in the form of coloured
flies or butterflies of diamonds, emeralds, and
rubies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Book-worm authorities, addicted to &ldquo;dry bones&rdquo;
of letters, are prone just now to doubt this visit of
Countess d'Aulnoy to the capital of Spain. But
if such patient doubters will compare her narrative
with those of other foreigners, <i>e.g.</i> Bertaut de
Rouen, or the manuscript description of Valladolid,
written by a Portuguese, and now in the British
Museum library, their scepticism will&mdash;or should&mdash;be
done away with on the moment. The letters
of the countess make it plain by copious inner
testimony that she actually performed her Spanish
visit; and though from time to time she over-colours
or misreads the truth, it was the very
usages of Spain that were absurd and out of
joint, and not, except in isolated instances, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sprightly and observant Frenchwoman's account
of them.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere the Countess says: &ldquo;Utensils of
common metal are not employed here, but only
those of silver or of ware. I hear that a little
while ago, upon the death of the Duke of Alburquerque,
six weeks were needed to make out an
inventory of his gold and silver services. His
house contained fourteen hundred dozen plates,
five hundred large dishes, and seven hundred of a
smaller size, with all the other pieces in proportion,
and forty silver ladders for climbing his sideboard,
made in grades like an altar in a spacious hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These statements have been proved in later
years. Dating from 1560, an inventory of the
ducal house of Alburquerque was found not many
years ago. In it we find the detailed list of gold
and silver; cups and dishes, bowls and basins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
plates and salt-cellars, trenchers, wine and water
flagons, sauce-spoons, salad-spoons, conserve-spoons,
and innumerable other articles. Here,
too, we find, upon the mighty sideboard mounted
by its forty silver stairs, such objects as the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gold cup with festoon-work above and
beneath, wrought with leaves in relief. At
the top of the foot there issue some leaves
that fall down over a small gold staple, and
below this, about the narrowest part of the foot,
are leaves in relief and several dolphins. The
broad part of the foot is decorated with festoons.
The lid of this cup is wrought with leaves
in relief, and on the crest thereof is a lion,
crowned. The cup weighs three hundred and
fifty-one <i>castellanos</i> and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Castilian jar from which my lord the duke
was wont to drink, weighing two marks and five
ounces.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;A cup with a high foot, gilt all over, with the
figure of a woman in its midst, and decorated in
four places in the Roman manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A flagon of white silver, flat beneath the stem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with a screw-top surmounted by a small lion; for
cooling water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small silver dish, of the kind they call meat-warmers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large silver seal for sealing provisions, with
the arms of my lord the duke, Don Francisco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large silver vessel, embossed, with a savage
on top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gold horse, enamelled in white upon a gold
plate enamelled in green and open at the top;
also a wolf, upon another gold plate enamelled in
green, with lettering round about it; also a green
enamelled lizard upon blue enamel; and a gold
toothpick with four pieces enamelled in green,
white, and rose; also a small gold column enamelled
in black and rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A silver lemon-squeezer, gilt and chiselled,
with white scroll-work about the mesh thereof,
through which the lemon-juice is strained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large round silver salt-cellar, in two halves,
gilt all over, with scales about the body, and two
thick twisted threads about the flat part. One
side of it is perforated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the property of the duchess, Doña
Mencía Enriquez, we find &ldquo;a small gold padlock,
which opens and closes by means of letters&rdquo;; two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
gold bangles; a gold necklace consisting of forty-two
pieces &ldquo;enamelled with some B's&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> a gold
signet ring with the duchess's arms; and &ldquo;a gold
and niello box with relics, for wearing round the
neck.&rdquo; Also, resting on a table covered with silver
plates, &ldquo;a box of combs; the said box wrought in
gold upon blue leather, containing five combs, a
looking-glass, a little brush, and other fittings;
girt with a cord in gold and blue silk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The seventeenth century and a race of native
Spanish kings declined and passed away together.
A dynasty of France succeeded to the throne
of Spain, and with the foreigner came a fresh
reactionary movement towards the neo-classic art,
coupled with the canons of French taste. Henceforth
a century of slow political reform goes
hand in hand with slow suppression of the salient
parts of Spanish character. Madrid transforms or
travesties herself into a miniature Versailles, and
national arts and crafts belong henceforward to a
Frenchified society which found its painter in
Goya, just as the preceding and eminently Spanish
society had found its painter in Velazquez.</p>

<p>Another of the causes of the falling-off in
Spanish <i>orfebrería</i> at this time, is stated to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
been the craftsmen's overwhelming tendency to
substitute the slighter though venerable and
beautiful gold or silver filigree (Plate <a href="#img_114.jpg">xviii</a>.), for
more artistic and ambitious, if less showy work
in massive metal. Thus, in 1699, a supplementary
chapter of the Ordinances of Seville
complained in bitter phrases of this tendency,
denouncing it as &ldquo;a source of fraud and
detriment to the republic,&rdquo; and deploring that
&ldquo;of the last few years we have forsaken our
goodly usages of older times, in the matter of the
drawings entrusted to the candidates who come
before us for examination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the same year the goldsmiths' and the
silversmiths' guild of Seville enacted that none
of its members were to work in filigree, unless
they were qualified to execute the other work as
well. Such efforts to suppress this evil were not
new. More than a century before, on April 15th,
1567, the inspectors of the guild had entered the
shop of Luis de Alvarado, silversmith, and seized
some filigree earrings &ldquo;of the work that is forbidden,&rdquo;
breaking these objects on the spot, and
imposing a fine of half-a-dozen ducats on the
peccant of obvious Alvarado.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The modern gold and silver work of Spain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
thus exempted from a lengthy notice, seeing that
its typical and national characteristics have succumbed,
or very nearly so. I may, however,
mention the giant silver candelabra in the
cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, which were made
at Barcelona, between 1704 and 1718, by Juan
Matons and three of his assistants. They measure
eight feet high by four feet and a quarter across,
weigh more than eight thousand ounces, and cost
21,942 pounds, 15 <i>sueldos</i>, and 11 <i>dineros</i> of
Majorcan money. The State seized them during
the Napoleonic wars, in order to melt them down
for money; but the chapter of the cathedral bought
them back for eleven thousand dollars.</p>

<p class="caption">EARLY CHALICE AND CROSS IN FILIGREE GOLD-WORK<br />
(<i>Church of Saint Isidore, León</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>During this century Riaño mentions several
factories of silver articles established at Madrid,
including that of Isaac and Michael Naudin (1772)
and the Escuela de Platería (1778), protected by
Charles the Third; but since the work of these was
purely in the French or English manner, they call
for no particular notice. The principal objects they
produced were &ldquo;inkstands, dishes, dinner-services,
chocolate-stands, cruets, knives and forks, together
with buckles, needle-cases, brooches, snuff-boxes,
frames for miniatures, and similar trinkets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth century Laborde wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that &ldquo;the fabrication of articles of gold and silver
might become an important object in a country
where these metals abound; but it is neglected,
and the demand is almost entirely supplied from
foreign markets. What little they do in this branch
at home is usually very ill executed, and exorbitantly
dear. Madrid, however, begins to possess
some good workmen; encouragement would
increase their number and facilitate the means
of improvement; but manual labour is there
excessively dear. Hence the Spaniards prefer
foreign articles of this kind, which, notwithstanding
the expense of carriage, the enormous duties that
they pay, and the profits of the merchants, are
still cheaper than those made at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several of the inherent characteristics of the
national <i>orfebrería</i> may yet be noticed somewhat
faintly in the ornaments and jewels of the
Spanish peasants, though even these are being
discarded. A century ago Laborde described the
dress of the Mauregata women, near Astorga,
in the kingdom of León. &ldquo;They wear large
earrings, a kind of white turban, flat and widened
like a hat, and their hair parted on the forehead.
They have a chemise closed over the chest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a brown corset buttoned, with large sleeves opening
behind. Their petticoats and veils are also
brown. Over all they wear immense coral necklaces,
which descend from the neck to the knee;
they twist them several times round the neck,
pass them over the shoulders, where a row is
fastened, forming a kind of bandage over the
bosom. Then another row lower than this; in
short, a third and fourth row at some distance
from each other. The last falls over the knee,
with a large cross on the right side. These
necklaces or chaplets are ornamented with a great
many silver medals, stamped with the figure of
saints. They only wear these decorations when
not working, or on festivals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have a manuscript account in French of
Spanish regional costumes at the same period.
The dress of the peasant women of Valencia is
thus described: &ldquo;Elle se coiffe toujours en
cheveux, de la manière appelée <i>castaña</i>, et elle y
passe une aiguille en argent que l'on nomme
<i>rascamoño</i>; quelque fois elle se pare d'un grand
peigne (<i>peineta</i>) en argent doré. Son cou este
orné d'une chaine d'or ou d'argent (<i>cadena del
cuello</i>) à laquelle est suspendue une croix ou un
reliquaire.&rdquo; This was the Valencian peasant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
dress for every day. On festivals the same
woman would adorn her ears with &ldquo;pendants
(<i>arracadas</i>) de pierres fausses; mais lorsque la
jardinière est riche, elles sont fines. Une relique
(<i>relicario</i>) dans un petit médaillon en argent,
est suspendue à son cou; ainsi qu'un chapelet
très mince (<i>rosario</i>) en argent doré.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peasant women of Iviza, in the Balearics,
are described in the same manuscript as wearing
&ldquo;un collier en verre, quelque fois en argent, et
rarement en or&rdquo;; while Laborde wrote of Minorca,
another of these islands, that &ldquo;the ladies are
always elegantly adorned; their ornaments consist
of necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings, and chaplets.
<i>The peasants wear these also.</i>&rdquo; Of the women of
Barcelona he said: &ldquo;Silk stockings are very
common in every class; and their shoes are
embroidered with silk, gold, silver, pearls, and
spangles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Spain, like Italy or Switzerland, or many
another country, is throwing off her regional
costumes, of which these various jewels form a
prominent and even an essential feature. More
rarely now we come across the gold and seed-pearl
necklaces of Salamanca, the Moorish filigree
silver-work of Cordova, the silver-gilt necklaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of Santiago, and the heavy <i>arracadas</i>, hung with
emeralds and sapphires, of Cataluña. Murcia,
nevertheless, retains her Platería, a street of
venerable aspect and associations, where to this
hour the oriental-looking silver pendants of the
neighbourhood are made and trafficked in.</p>

commonly, says Rosell de Torres, &ldquo;a plate of gold or ivory, or other
metal or material, according to the time and circumstances of its
manufacture. The priest who celebrates the Mass kisses it after
the <i>Agnus Dei</i> and the prayer <i>ad petendam pacem</i>, and the acolytes
present it, as a sign of peace and brotherly union, to all the other
priests who may be present. This usage springs from the kiss of peace
which was exchanged, prior to receiving the communion, between the
early Christians in their churches. The pax has commonly borne
an image of the Virgin with the Holy Infant, the face of Christ, or
else the Agnus Dei.&rdquo; Its Latin name was the <i>deosculatorium</i>.</p></div>

Oviedo cathedral, and was duly shown the relics and the jewels.
Among these latter was the &lsquo;Cross of the Angels.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why is it so called?&rsquo; inquired the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; replied the bishop of the diocese, &lsquo;it is said that the
angels made it to reward King Alfonso the Chaste.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, but,&rsquo; insisted the young monarch, &lsquo;what ground is there
for thinking so?&rsquo;</p>

Spaniard and the Moor. This was a natural consequence in
places where the vanquished had a better education than the
victor. The warrior population of both races might be struggling
on the field at the same moment that their craftsmen were fraternizing
in the workshop. Ferdinand the First and Alfonso the Sixth
were particularly lenient in their usage of the dominated Muslim.
Thus, the former of these princes recognised the Moorish townspeople
of Sena as his vassals, while those of Toledo were freely
allowed by Alfonso to retain their worship and their mosque.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Together with the statuette of Ujué in Navarre, the Virgen de
la Vega of Salamanca may be classed as one of the earliest &ldquo;local
Virgins&rdquo; of this country. Sometimes these images are of wood
alone, sometimes of wood beneath a silver covering, sometimes, as
that of the Claustro de León, of stone. But whatever may be the
substance, the characteristics are the same:&mdash;Byzantine rigidness
and disproportion, the crude and primitive anatomy of artists only
just emerging from the dark. The Virgin and Child of Santa
María la Real of Hirache in Navarra may be instanced as
another of the series. This image dates from late in the twelfth or
early in the thirteenth century, although a crown and nimbus have
been added subsequently. It measures rather more than a yard
in height, and consists of wood covered with silver plates, except
the hands and face, which are painted. The Virgin, seated, holds
the Infant with her left arm; in her right hand is an apple. A kind of
stole bearing the following inscription in Gothic letter falls upon the
Infant's breast; &ldquo;<i>Puer natus est nobis, venite adoremus. Ego
sum alpha et omega, primus et novissimus Dominus.</i>&rdquo; Before this
statuette the King Don Sancho is stated to have offered his devotion.</p></div>

three years ago, a silly rogue removed and carried off the crown
from Santiago's head; but since the actual jewel is only worn on
solemn festivals, his prize turned out to be a worthless piece of tin.
An odd removal of the treasure of another Spanish church was noted
by the traveller Bowles. &ldquo;The curate of the place, a worthy fellow
who put me up in his house, assured me that a detachment of a legion
of locusts entered the church, ate up the silk clothes upon the images,
and gnawed the varnish on the altars.&rdquo; Perhaps these adamantine-stomached
insects have assailed, from time to time, the gold and
silver plate of Santiago.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: right;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Santiago</span>, <i>May 7th, 1906</i> (9.15 <i>p.m.</i>).</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning, when the canon in charge of the Chapel of the
Relics unlocked the door, he was surprised to observe that some of
these were lying in confusion on the floor. Fearing that a theft
had been committed, he sent for the dean and others of the clergy,
who had examination made, and found the following objects to be
missing:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;A gold cross, presented by King Alfonso the Great, when he
attended the consecration of this temple in the year 874.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Another cross, of silver, dating from the fifteenth century&mdash;a
present from Archbishop Spinola.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An aureole of the fifteenth century, studded with precious stones
belonging to a statuette of the apostle Santiago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The authorities were summoned and at once began their search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They find that two of the thick iron bars of the skylight in the
ceiling of the cloister have been filed through. This cloister has a
skylight which opens upon the chapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have also found, upon the roof, a knotted rope. This rope
was only long enough to reach a cornice in the chapel wall. <i>The
wall itself affords no sign that anybody has attempted to descend
by it.</i>&rdquo;</p></div>

Sacro</i>, describes another one, also preserved at Santiago, saying
that it was a bust of silver, life-size and gilded to the breast, &ldquo;with
a large diadem of rays and many stones, both small and great, all
or most of them of fine quality, though not of the most precious.&rdquo;
Other bust-reliquaries belong, or have belonged, to the Cathedrals
of Burgos and Toledo.</p></div>

fusion of the Christian and the Saracenic elements, we find Mudejar

class; for ladies of the aristocracy and of the older noble families
display a vast variety of gems, such as rubies, chrysolites, emeralds,
and pearls of great value. The ladies of Granada are commonly
fair to look upon, shapely, of good stature, with long hair, teeth of a
shining white, and perfumed breath, gracefully alert in their movements,
and witty and agreeable in conversation. But unfortunately
at this time their passion for painting themselves and for arraying
themselves in every kind of jewellery and costly stuffs has reached
a pitch that is no longer tolerable.&rdquo;&mdash;Al-Jattib, in <i>The Splendour

export from Spain the precious metals, in any form, whether as

of this offence was death. Another law prohibited all foreigners
who were resident in Spain, not excluding the Moriscos, from buying
gold or silver in the bar (<i>Suma de Leyes</i>, p. 46). It was also forbidden
to sell the jewels or other objects of value belonging to a

<h2><a name="IRON-WORK" id="IRON-WORK">IRON-WORK</a></h2>

<p>The ancient iron mines of Spain were no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
celebrated than her mines of silver and of gold.
Nevertheless, the history of Spanish iron-work
begins comparatively late. Excepting certain
swords and other weapons which require to be
noticed under <i>Arms</i>, and owing to the commonness
and cheapness of this metal, as well as to
the ease with which it decomposes under damp,
few of the earliest Spanish objects made of iron
have descended to our time.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Even Riaño pays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
but little notice to this craft in the Peninsula
before the second half of the fifteenth century.
Henceforth, he says, &ldquo;it continued to progress
in the sixteenth, and produced, undoubtedly,
at that period works which were unrivalled in
Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The decorative iron-work of Spain may suitably
be dealt with in three classes: railings, screens,
or pulpits of churches, chapels, and cathedrals;
balconies and other parts or fittings applied to
public or private buildings of a non-ecclesiastical
character; and smaller, though not necessarily less
attractive or important objects, such as knockers,
locks and keys, and nail-heads.</p>

<p>The last of these divisions, as embracing
Spanish-Moorish craftsmanship, shall have, as far
as order is concerned, our preferential notice.</p>

<p>Surely, in the whole domain of history, no
object has a grander symbolism than the key.
In mediæval times the keys of cities, castles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
towns, and fortresses were held to be significant
of ownership, or vigilance, or conquest. Especially
was this the case in Spain&mdash;a nation incessantly
engaged in war. Probably in no
country in the world has the ceremony of delivering
up this mark of tenure of a guarded
and defended place occurred so often as here.
Do we not read of it in stirring stanzas of her
literature? Do we not find it in her paintings,
on her stone and metal <i>rilievi</i>, or carved in
wood upon the stalls of her cathedrals? Therefore
the key, just like the sword, seemed, in
the warm imagination of the Spaniards, to be
something almost sacred. The legislative codes
of Old Castile are most minute in their relation
of its venerated attributes. Nor were the Spanish
Muslims less alive to its importance than their
foe, taking it also for an emblem of their own,
and planting it in lordly eminence upon their
gates and towers of Cordova, and Seville, and
Granada. For what was Tarik's Mountain but
the key of the narrow gate that led to their
enchanted land, as sunny as, and yet less
sultry than, their sandy home; truly a land
of promise to the fiery children of the desert,
panting for the paradise that smiled at them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
across the storied strip of emerald and sapphire
water?</p>

<p>So was it that both Moors and Spaniards
made their keys of fortresses and citadels almost
into an object of their worship. In hearing or in
reading of such keys, the mind at once recurs to
those of Seville (Plate <a href="#img_134.jpg">xix</a>.), two in number, famed
throughout the world of mediæval art, and stored
among the holiest relics in the sacristy of her
cathedral. The larger is of silver, in the style now
known as Mudejar, and dates from the second half
of the thirteenth century. The length is rather
more than eight inches, and the whole key is
divided into five compartments, ornamented in
enamels and in gold. Castles, ships, and lions
adorn the thicker portion of the stem between
the barrel proper and the handle; and on the
rim of the latter is this inscription, in Hebrew
characters:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>The King of Kings will open; the king of all the
land shall enter.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The wards are also beautifully carved into the
following legend, distributed in two rows, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
superposed upon the other, of two words and of
ten letters apiece:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Dios abrirá; Rey entrará.</i>&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>God will open; the king shall enter.</i>&rdquo;</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The iron key is purely Moorish, smaller than
its fellow, and measures just over six inches.
Like the other, it consists of five divisions, and
the wards are in the form of an inscription in
African Cufic characters, which Gayangos and
other Arabists have variously interpreted. Five
of the commonest readings are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) &ldquo;<i>May Allah permit that the rule (of Islam) last for
ever in this city.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>(2) &ldquo;<i>By the grace of God may (this key) last for ever.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>(3) &ldquo;<i>May peace be in the King's mansion.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>(4) &ldquo;<i>May God grant us the boon of the preservation of
the city.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>(5) &ldquo;<i>To God (belongs) all the empire and the power.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our earliest tidings of this iron key are from
the Jesuit Bernal, who wrote in the seventeenth
century. It was not then the property of the
cathedral chapter, for Ortiz de Zúñiga says
that it belonged, in the same century, to a gentleman
of Seville named Don Antonio Lopez de
Mesa, who had inherited it from his father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Tradition declares that both this key and its
companion were laid at the feet of Ferdinand
the Third by Axataf, governor of Seville, when
the city capitulated to the Christian prince on
November 23rd, 1248. But Ortiz is careful to
inform us that he neither countenances nor rejects
the popular notion that the iron key was thus
delivered as the token of surrender, &ldquo;although,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;the owners of it are strongly of this
judgment.&rdquo; What we do know is that on June
16th, 1698, the iron key was presented to the
cathedral by Doña Catalina Basilia Domonte y
Pinto, niece of the Señor Lopez de Mesa aforesaid;
and that the chapter forthwith accepted it
with solemn gratitude as &ldquo;one of the keys
delivered by the Moors to the Rey Santo on the
conquest of the city,&rdquo; ordering it to be guarded
in a special box.</p>

<p>Such is the popular fancy still accepted by the
Sevillanos. However, Amador de los Ríos has
sifted out a good deal of the truth, showing that
the iron and the silver key are wrought in
different styles, and were intended for a different
purpose. He places the iron instrument among
the &ldquo;keys of conquered cities,&rdquo; and its silver
neighbour among the &ldquo;keys of honour, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dedication&rdquo;; and he declares as certain (although
the reasons he adduces do not quite convince me)
that this iron key is actually the one which figured
in the ceremony of surrender. The other he considers
to have been a gift from the Sevillians to
the tenth Alfonso, son of Ferdinand the saint
and conqueror, as a loyal and a grateful offering
in return for his protection of their industries and
commerce. However this may be, the decorative
aspect of the larger key, together with the choice
material of which it is made, appears to prove
that it was not associated with the rigours of a
siege, but served in some way as a symbol of
prosperity and peace. It was a common custom
at a later age for Spanish cities to present their
sovereign, when he came among them, with a
richly ornamented key. Such keys were offered
to Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second
when, in 1526 and 1570, respectively, they
visited Seville; while Riaño reminds us that
&ldquo;even in the present day the ceremony is still
kept up of offering a key to the foreign princes
who stay at the royal palace of Madrid.&rdquo; Similarly,
as an ordinary form of salutation, does the
well-bred Spaniard place his house at your
disposal.</p>

<p>Five Moorish keys&mdash;one of bronze and four of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
iron&mdash;are in the Museum of Segovia, and bear,
as Amador observes, a general resemblance to
the iron key of Seville. The wards of four of
them are shaped into the following inscriptions:
the first key, &ldquo;<i>In Secovia</i> (Segovia)&rdquo;; the second,
&ldquo;(<i>This</i>) <i>key was curiously wrought at Medina
Huelma, God protect her</i>&rdquo;; the third, &ldquo;<i>Open</i>&rdquo;;
and the fourth, &ldquo;<i>This work is by Abdallah.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first and smallest of these keys informs
us, therefore, that it was manufactured at Segovia.
The third key is that which is of bronze, and
bears the word &ldquo;<i>Open</i>,&rdquo; probably addressed to
Allah. The second, which is also the largest
and the most artistic and ornate, belonged, we
read upon its wards, to Huelma, a fortress-town
upon the frontiers of the kingdom of Granada.
This town was wrested from the Moors on April
20th, 1438, by Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza, first
Marquis of Santillana, who possibly sent this key
to Castile as a present to his sovereign, Juan the
Second, in company with the usual papers of
capitulation.</p>

<p>Other Moorish keys are scattered over Spain
in various of her public and private collections,
though none are so remarkable as those of Seville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and Segovia. The town of Sepúlveda possesses
seven early iron keys, several of which are
Moorish. Others are at Burgos, Valencia, Palma,
Jaen, and Granada. At the last-named city the
following key, dating undoubtedly from the period
of the Muslim domination, was discovered, in
1901, among the débris of the Palace of Seti
Meriem.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

        <a name="img_131.jpg" id="img_131.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>Keys of awe-inspiring magnitude are still preferred
among the Spaniards to a handier and
slighter instrument, this people seeming to believe
that the bigger the key the more inviolable is
the custody which it affords&mdash;a theory not at all
upheld by modern experts in this venerable
craft. Perhaps this singular and local preference
is derived from Barbary. At any rate it still
obtains across the Strait. &ldquo;Our host,&rdquo; wrote Mr
Cunninghame Graham in <i>Mogreb-El-Acksa</i>,
&ldquo;knocks off great pieces from a loaf of cheap
French sugar with the key of the house, drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it from his belt and hammering lustily, as the
key weighs about four ounces, and is eight or
nine inches long.&rdquo; Of such a length are nearly
all the house-keys of contemporary Spain; and
with this apparatus bulging in his belt the somnolent
<i>sereno</i> or night-watchman of this sleepy,
unprogressive, Latino-Mussulmanic land prowls
to this hour along the starlit streets of Barcelona,
Seville, or Madrid.</p>

<p>The city Ordinances of Granada form a valuable
and interesting link between the Spanish-Moorish
craftsmanship and that of Spaniards
Christian-born. The <i>Ordenanzas de Cerrageros</i>,
or Locksmiths' Ordinances, though not voluminous,
are curious and informative beyond the rest,
and show us that a general rascality was prevalent
in Granada after her reconquest from the
Moor. Locksmiths were forbidden now to make
a lock the impression of which was put into their
hands in wax, even if the order should be
sweetened by &ldquo;a quantity of maravedis,&rdquo; since the
effect of such commissions, whose very secrecy
betrayed illicit and improper ends in view, was
stated to be &ldquo;very greatly perilous and mischief-making.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another Ordinance reveals the Christian locksmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of Granada as arrant scoundrels, almost
as troublesome to deal with as the pestering
little shoeblacks of to-day. &ldquo;Word is brought
us,&rdquo; groaned the aldermen, &ldquo;how many locksmiths,
foreigners that dwell within this city as well as
naturals that go up and down our thoroughfares,
in taking locks and padlocks to repair, do, at the
same time that they set the keys in order, contrive
to fit them with new wards inferior to the older ones,
so as to be able to open and close them with the
keys they have themselves in store, wherein is
grave deceitfulness, seeing that the aforesaid locks
and padlocks may be opened in such wise without
a key at all.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>If we except the vast dimensions of the common
keys of houses, this branch of Spanish
craftsmanship has now no quality to point it from
the rest of Europe, having become, in Riaño's
words, &ldquo;simply practical and useful.&rdquo; Laborde
observed in 1809 that &ldquo;locks and various iron
utensils are made in divers places. Locksmiths
are numerous at Vega de Ribadeo in Galicia, at
Helgoivar in Biscay, at Vergara in Guipuscoa, at
Solsona and Cardona in Catalonia. Different kinds
of iron goods are manufactured at Vergara, Solsona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and Cardona. The articles made of iron and
steel at Solsona are in high estimation, notwithstanding
they are destitute of taste and elegance,
badly finished, and worse polished; and can by
no means be put in competition with similar
articles introduced from other countries.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Iron nails with ornamented heads and decorative
door-knockers are other objects which reveal
the influence of Mohammedan Spain. A number
of artistic Spanish nails are in the South Kensington
Museum. &ldquo;Some doors,&rdquo; says Riaño, &ldquo;still
exist at the Alhambra, Granada, covered with
enormous heads of nails of a half-spherical form
with embossed pattern. These same nails are constantly
to be found on old Spanish houses, to which
are added in the angles pieces of iron of a most
artistic order&rdquo; (Pl. <a href="#img_134.jpg">xix</a>.<span class="smcap">a</span>). In the same city, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not precisely in the Alhambra, I have seen upon
the doors of private houses nails of a decorative
kind which appear to consist of a single piece,
but which are really formed of two&mdash;an ornamental
boss perforated through its centre, and the
nail proper, which fastens through it to the woodwork
of the door behind. Thus, when the nail is
hammered tight upon the boss, the effect is naturally
that of a single piece of metal. Similar nails
are on the door of Tavera's hospital at Toledo.</p>

<p>The <i>Ordenanzas</i> of Granada tell us minutely
of the nails which were produced there in the
sixteenth century. They were denominated <i>cabriales</i>,
<i>costaneros</i>, <i>palmares</i>, <i>bolayques</i>, <i>vizcainos</i>,
sabetinos, and <i>moriscos</i>; of all of which I can
only find that the <i>cabriales</i> and <i>costaneros</i> were
used for beams and rafters, and the <i>moriscos</i> for
fixing horse-shoes. In Spain the custom of
fastening down the decorative coverings of chairs
or benches dates from comparatively late; and
it was probably with this innovation that iron-workers
began to exercise their ingenuity upon
the heads of nails.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the Middle Ages the city
of Segovia was celebrated for her locks and keys,
her knockers, and her <i>rejas</i>. In 1892, collections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of iron objects, chiefly manufactured in this town,
were shown by the duke of Segovia, Don Nicolás
Duque, and Don Adolfo Herrera at the Exposición
Histórico-Europea of Madrid. Segovia still
preserves an old door covered with extraordinary
iron spikes, that once belonged to the castle of
Pedraza; many curious balconies, such as that in
a first floor of the Calle del Carmen; and the
grilles&mdash;proceeding from the old cathedral&mdash;of
the chapel of the Cristo del Consuelo and the
chapel of the Piedad.</p>

<p>Another interesting collection of early decorative
Spanish iron, belonging to the well-known
painter, Señor Rusiñol, is kept at the town
of Sitjes, in Cataluña. The late Marquis of
Arcicollar possessed a number of specimens of
Spanish manufactured iron of the later Middle
Ages, such as boxes, candelabra, locks, nails,
door-knockers, <i>braseros</i>, and a rare and curious
iron desk (fourteenth century), with leather
fittings.</p>

<p>The collection of the late Count of Valencia de
Don Juan included four door-knockers of Spanish
iron, dating from late in the fifteenth century or
early in the sixteenth. I give a reproduction of
these knockers (Pl. <a href="#img_136.jpg">xx</a>.). The two which occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the centre are evidently from a sacred building;
while the other pair are just as evidently <i>señoriales</i>,
and belonged to a noble house. In the former
pair, the clumsy carving of the saints, Peter and
James, is attributed by Serrano Fatigati to the
native coarseness of the iron.</p>

<p>Proceeding from the same collection are a pair
of ceremonial maces and a ceremonial lantern,
which I also reproduce (Pl. <a href="#img_138.jpg">xxi</a>.), since the Spanish
writer from whom I have just quoted pronounces
them to be &ldquo;excellent specimens of the iron-work
of our country at the close of the Middle Ages.&rdquo;
He says that, as we notice in the pinnacles, they
show a tendency to copy architectural detail, and
are otherwise characteristic of the period. Towards
the fourteenth century the file replaced the
hammer, and the sheet of iron was substituted for
the bar. These objects, dating from the fifteenth
century, duly reveal this change. Also, as was
usual at the time, they are composed of separate
pieces stoutly riveted. In the knockers with
the figures of the saints &ldquo;we notice the partial
use of the chisel, which became general in the
sixteenth century, at the same time that iron
objects were loaded with images, forms of animals,
and other capricious figures. These may be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to belong to a period of transition, culminating in
the <i>rejas</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The Madrid Museum contains a sixteenth-century
cross of <i>repoussé</i> iron, in the Greek form,
and which is certainly of Spanish make. According
to Villa-amil, it formerly had a gilded border
and was painted black, which leads this writer
to suppose that it was used at funerals. Iron
crosses may be seen occasionally on churches and
on other public buildings, and Stirling has inserted
cuts of several in his <i>Annals of the Artists of
Spain</i>. Crosses of large size were sometimes
planted on the highway. Such was the elaborate
but ugly iron cross, measuring three yards in
height, made by Sebastian Conde in 1692 for
the Plazuela de la Cerrajeriá in Seville, and now
preserved in her Museum.</p>

<p>The iron balustrade or <i>verja</i> of the marble
tomb of Cardinal Cisneros is finely wrought in
Plateresque-Renaissance, with elaborate designs
of gryphons, foliage, urns, birds, masks, sheep's
heads, swans, coats of arms, dolphins, and other
ornament in great profusion. The craftsman was
Nicolás de Vergara the elder. Lesser in size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
though not less striking in its execution, is the
railing, by Francisco de Villalpando, which surrounds
the <i>Altar de Prima</i> in the choir of Toledo
Cathedral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iron pulpits,&rdquo; says Riaño, &ldquo;have been made
in Spain with great success.&rdquo; He mentions five:
two in Avila Cathedral (Plate <a href="#img_140.jpg">xxii</a>.); two at
Seville; and one at the church of San Gil at
Burgos. The latter is described by Street, who
says: &ldquo;It is of very late date, end of the fifteenth
century, but I think it quite worthy of illustration.
The support is of iron, resting on stone, and the
staircase modern. The framework at the angles,
top and bottom, is of wood, upon which the iron-work
is laid. The traceries are cut out of two
plates of iron, laid one over the other, and the
iron-work is in part gilded, but I do not think
that this is original. The canopy is of the same
age and character, and the whole effect is very
rich at the same time that it is very novel. I saw
other pulpits, but none so old as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The iron pulpits of Salamanca, &ldquo;covered with
bas-reliefs representing the Evangelists and
subjects taken from the Acts of the Apostles and
the apocalypse,&rdquo; were made at the same time as
the <i>reja</i> by Fray Francisco de Zalamea or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Salamanca, Fray Juan, and other artists. The
two at Avila are stationed one on either side
of the Capilla Mayor, and are of gilded iron,
hexagonal in form, and measuring about ten feet
in height. Gryphons or other beasts support the
pulpit on its stem or column. The body of each
pulpit bears the arms of the cathedral, namely,
the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, a lion, and a castle&mdash;the whole
surmounted by a crown&mdash;and is divided lengthways
by a central band into a double tier, closed
by a richly decorated cornice at the upper and the
lower border. Otherwise the pulpits are quite
dissimilar. In one the decorative scheme is almost
purely geometrical, while in the other it consists
of foliage, birds and beasts, and niches containing
statuettes of saints. The stair-railings are modern;
but the primitive carving still adorns the end of
every step.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>We do not know who was the maker of these
pulpits. Some believe him to have been a certain
Juan Francés, to whom our notice will again be
called as figuring among the earliest masters of
this eminently Spanish craft, and who, on strongish
evidence, is thought to be the author of the <i>rejas</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in the same cathedral which enclose the choir, and
the front and sides of the Capilla Mayor. This
is the only reason for supposing him to have
made the pulpits also. One of these, however,
is in the Flamboyant, and the other in the
Renaissance style; so it may well be doubted
whether both were produced by the same hand,
or even at exactly the same period.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, in the <i>rejas</i> that the craftsmanship
of older Spain attains its loftiest pinnacle.
They consist, says Banister Fletcher, of &ldquo;rich
and lofty grilles in hammered and chiselled iron &hellip; strongly
characteristic of the national art.
The formality of the long and vertical bars is
relieved by figures beaten in <i>repoussé</i>, in duplicates,
attached back to back, and by crestings
and traceries adapted to the material, and
freely employed. Few things in Spain are
more original and artistic.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The <i>reja</i> generally was not, as many have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
supposed, of late invention. It existed from the
earliest days of Christianity; but it was only in
the Gothic and Renaissance ages that Spain
converted it into a vehicle for decorative art.
The growth of these ornamental <i>rejas</i> may be
traced in cities of Old Castile, together with
Seville, Salamanca, Cuenca, and Toledo. Spain,
it is idle to observe, was at no moment so
appreciative of her craftsmen as was Italy, so
that our information as to mediæval Spanish
craftsmen and the process of their lives and
labours is, upon the whole, deplorably deficient.
Nevertheless, among the oldest of her artists
known in Spanish as <i>rejeros</i>, or (a finer and
more venerable term) <i>&ldquo;reja</i>-masters&rdquo;&mdash;<i>maestros
de rexas</i>&mdash;appears Juan Francés, working in
1494 in Toledo Cathedral and, in the same
capacity (for he seems to have been an armourer
besides, and to have held the title of &ldquo;master-maker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of iron arms in Spain&rdquo;)<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> at Alcalá de
Henares, as well as, in 1505, at Osma, in whose
cathedral he made the <i>rejas</i> of the choir and high
chapel.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Although the craftsman's name has rarely been
recorded, we know that excellent <i>rejería</i> was
made at Barcelona in the fifteenth century. Also
dating from the fifteenth century, and therefore
prior to the Plateresque, is the <i>reja</i>, ornamented
with leaves and figures of centaurs and other
creatures, mythical and real, enclosing the
sepulchre of the Anayas in the old cathedral of
Salamanca. During the first quarter of the sixteenth
century much work in decorative <i>rejería</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
was completed in Seville Cathedral by Fernando
Prieto, Fray Francisco de Salamanca,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Sancho
Muñoz, Diego de Adrobo, and others (<i>vide</i>
Frontispiece). Taught by these, while yet belonging
to a slightly later time, and linking in
this way the riper and decadent Gothic with
the new Renaissance and the Plateresque, were
Pedro de Andino, Antonio de Palencia, and Juan
Delgado. Rosell observes that without doubt
these artists, excepting only Juan Francés&mdash;the
pioneer of them all&mdash;were Spanish-born; and
they in their turn were succeeded by other
Spaniards who worked most regularly at Toledo;
such as Bartolomé Rodriguez, Luis de Peñafiel,
and Francisco de Silva.</p>

<p>An excellent <i>rejero</i> named Hernando de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Arenas completed the grille of Cuenca Cathedral
in 1557. Three years before, a Cordovese,
Fernando de Valencia, had made the intricate
Renaissance <i>reja</i> of the Chapel of the Asunción
in the mosque of that most ancient capital&mdash;a
noble piece of work, which still exists. Other
<i>rejeros</i> who were either natives of, or who resided
in, this city were Pedro Sanchez, Alonso
Perez, Pedro Sanchez Cardenosa, Francisco
Lopez, Juan Martinez Cano, and Diego de
Valencia.</p>

<p>One of these men, Alonso Perez, a native of
Jaen, contracted, on April 13th, 1576, to make
the <i>rejas</i> of the Capilla Mayor in the church of
the convent of the Trinity at Cordova. He was
to finish them within one year, at a cost of fifty-one
<i>maravedis</i> for every pound of iron, of sixteen
ounces to the pound. Ramírez de Arellano, who
has extracted these notices of Cordovese artists
from the city archives<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, says that the <i>reja</i> in
question is no longer standing; but a document
of the time informs us that it was of an elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
character, and carried architraves, cornices,
and the usual decorative detail of the Spanish
Renaissance.</p>

<p>In 1593 Pedro Sanchez agreed to make, within
four years, a grille for the old chapel of the
Concepción, also in Cordova, at a cost of forty-nine
maravedis for every pound of iron that the
finished <i>reja</i> should contain; and a year later the
same artist signed a contract for what is thought
to be his masterpiece&mdash;the <i>reja</i> of the chapel of
the Holy Cross, in the nave of the <i>sagrario</i> of
the same temple. The stipulated time was two
years only; but the cost amounted in this instance
to one hundred maravedis for every pound of the
completed <i>reja</i>.</p>

<p>Marvels of power and of patience are among
the <i>rejas</i> of this land. In them, obedient to the
genius of the craftsman, the ponderous metal
assumes the gossamer lightness of the finest
gauze, now seeming to be breathed rather than
built across the entrance to some side-chapel,
now tapering skyward till we fancy it to melt
away, like vapour, on the surface of the lofty
roof. Such are the screens&mdash;which here demand
a brief description&mdash;of Toledo and Palencia and
Granada; that of Cuenca, where Arenas plied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
his master-hand; and, first in merit of them all,
the peerless <i>reja</i>, royal in magnificence and faultless
taste, that closes in at Burgos the no less
royal-looking chapel of a Count of Haro, sometime
Constable of all Castile.</p>

<p>The <i>reja</i> of the Capilla Mayor of Toledo
Cathedral is twenty-one feet high by forty-six in
breadth. &ldquo;Armies of workmen,&rdquo; wrote Méndez
Silva, referring to this screen and to its neighbour,
that of the <i>coro</i>, &ldquo;were toiling at them for ten
years, nor would their cost have been greater had
they been of founded silver.&rdquo; The cost of which
he speaks was more than a quarter of a million
<i>reales</i>, although the workmen's daily wage was
only two <i>reales</i> and a half, or, in the case of the
particularly skilled, four <i>reales</i>.</p>

<p>The author of this admirable screen was
Francisco de Villalpando, whose plans and
estimate were approved by Cardinal Tavera in
1540. &ldquo;The <i>reja</i> consists of two tiers resting on
different kinds of marble. Attic columns ornamented
with handsome <i>rilievi</i> and terminated
by bronze caryatides, divide these tiers into
several spaces. The upper tier is formed by
seven columns of ornate pattern, containing, on
a frieze of complicated tracery, figures of animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and angels, and other delicately drawn and
executed objects in relief. Upon the cornice are
coats of arms, angels, and other decoration; and
in the centre, the imperial arms of Charles the
Fifth, together with a large crucifix pendent from
a massive gilded chain. On the frieze of the
second tier are the words, <span class="smcap">ADORATE DOMINUM IN
ATRIO SANCTO EJUS KALENDAS APRILIS 1548</span>, and
on the inner side, <span class="smcap">PLUS ULTRA</span>.&rdquo; <a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The other of the larger <i>rejas</i> in this temple&mdash;that
of the choir&mdash;is not inferior in a great
degree to Villalpando's masterpiece. It was made
by &ldquo;Maestre&rdquo; Domingo (de Céspedes),<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> who, in
his estimate of June 18th, 1540, engaged to
finish it at a total cost of 5000 ducats, &ldquo;he to be
given the necessary gold and silver for the
plating&rdquo; (<i>Archives of Toledo Cathedral</i>, quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
by Rosell). This Maestre Domingo was aided
by his son-in-law, Fernando Bravo, and both of
them, says de la Rada y Delgado, were probably
natives of Toledo.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In the same city they also
made the <i>rejas</i> for the Baptismal Chapel, and
for the chapels of the Reyes Viejos and Reyes
Nuevos.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>REJA</i> OF CHAPEL ROYAL<br />
(<i>View from interior. Granada Cathedral</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Excellent Plateresque <i>rejas</i> are those of the
Capilla Mayor and Coro of Palencia Cathedral&mdash;the
latter from the hand of Gaspar Rodriguez of
Segovia, who finished it in 1571 at a cost of 3400
ducats. In the same city is the <i>reja</i> of the chapel
of Nuestra Señora la Blanca, finished in 1512 by
Juan Relojero, a Palencian, who received for his
labour 25,000 <i>maravedis</i> and a load and a half
of wheat.</p>

<p>The noble and colossal gilt and painted<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> <i>reja</i>
of the Chapel Royal of Granada Cathedral was
wrought between the years 1518 and 1523 by
one Master Bartholomew, whose name is near
the keyhole. This was a person of obscure life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
though mighty powers as a craftsman. We know
that he resided at Jaen, and, from a document
which still remains,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> that he petitioned Charles
the Fifth for payment (sixteen hundred ducats)
of this grille, because the clergy had continually
refused to liquidate it. He made, besides the
work I herewith describe, the <i>reja</i> of the presbytery
for Seville cathedral,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and possibly, as
Sentenach suggests, the iron tenebrarium, ten
feet high by five across, for the cathedral of Jaen.</p>

<p>The <i>reja</i> of the Chapel Royal of Granada, &ldquo;of
two faces, the finest that was ever made of this
material,&rdquo; <a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> has three tiers. &ldquo;The first tier
contains six Corinthian pilasters and a broad
frieze covered with Plateresque ornamentation, as
are the pedestals on which the pilasters rest. In
the second tier are the arms of Ferdinand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Isabella within a garland supported by two lions,
and other crowns together with the yoke and
arrows;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> all intertwined with stems, leaves, and
little angels of an exquisite effect. Before the
pilasters of this tier and of the one immediately
above it are figures of the apostles on Gothic
brackets&mdash;a style we also notice on the fastening
of the gate and on the twisted railing; but every
other detail of the grille is Plateresque. Upon
the top are scenes of martyrdoms and of the life
of Christ, the whole surmounted by a decorative
scheme of leaves and candelabra, and, over this, a
crucifix together with the figures of the Virgin and
Saint John. The designing of the figures is only
moderately good, but all remaining detail and the
craftsmanship are admirable&rdquo; <a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> (Plates <a href="#img_148.jpg">xxiii</a>. and
<a href="#img_149.jpg">xxiv</a>.).</p>

<p>Last on my list of Spanish <i>reja</i>-makers I place
the greatest and most honoured of them all&mdash;Cristóbal
de Andino, who, as a modern writer
has expressed it, &ldquo;uttered the last word in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
matter of giving shape to iron.&rdquo; Cristóbal, son
of Pedro de Andino&mdash;himself an artist of no
mean capacity&mdash;excelled in architecture, sculpture,
<i>rejería</i>, and probably in silver-work as well.
&ldquo;Good craftsmen,&rdquo; wrote his contemporary,
Diego de Sagredo, &ldquo;and those who wish their
work to breathe the spirit of authority and pass
without rebuke, should follow&mdash;like your fellow-townsman,
Cristóbal de Andino&mdash;ancient precepts,
in that his works have greater elegance and
beauty than any others that I witnessed heretofore.
If this (you think) be not the case, look at that
<i>reja</i> he is making for my lord the Constable,
which <i>reja</i> is well known to be superior to all
others of this kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such is the <i>reja</i> thought, both then and now,
to be the finest ever made. The style is pure
Renaissance. Two tiers of equal height consist
of four-and-twenty ornamented rails or balusters
disposed, above, between four columns; below,
between four pilasters. An attic is upon the
cornice, and contains two central, semi-naked,
kneeling figures which support a large, crowned
shield. This is surmounted by a bust of God the
Father, enclosed in a triangular frame, and
raising the hand to bless. On either side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
attic are S-shaped crests sustaining circular
medallions with the likenesses, in bold relief, of
Christ and Mary. Along the friezes are the
legends; <span class="smcap">EGO SUM ALPHA ET</span> &#937;; <span class="smcap">EGO SUM LUX
VERA</span>; and <span class="smcap">ECCE ANCILLA DOMINI</span>, together with the
words, referring to the artist, <span class="smcap">AB ANDINO</span>, and the
date <span class="smcap">A.D. MDXXIII.</span> The decorative scheme is
spirited and delicate at once, whether we observe
it on the railing, pilasters, and columns, or on
the horizontal parts and members of the <i>reja</i>.
The attic which surmounts the double tier and
cornice is finally surmounted by a gilt Saint
Andrew's cross; and the entire screen is lavishly
painted and gilded throughout.</p>

<p>Here is a thing&mdash;almost a being&mdash;created
out of iron, so intensely lovely that the eye
would wish to contemplate it to the end of
time; and, as we linger in its presence, if perchance
the dead are privileged to hear their
earthly praises echoed in the silence of the
tomb, surely from his marble sepulchre Cristóbal
de Andino listens to such praises at this hour.
For yonder, in the neighbouring parish church
of San Cosmé, beside a wife devoted and well-loved
the great artificer is laid to rest, where
Latin words (although of idle purport while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<i>reja</i> of the Constable remains) are deep engraved
to thus remind us of his worth:&mdash;</p>

<p>But if these splendid <i>rejas</i> of her temples
constitute to-day a special glory of this nation,
her private balconies and window-gratings were
in former times, though from profaner motives,
almost or quite as notable. Between the sixteenth
and the eighteenth centuries, few of the
foreigners who visited Spain omitted to record
their admiration of these balconies, crowded upon
a holiday with pretty women. &ldquo;Il y avoit,&rdquo;
wrote Bertaut de Rouen in 1659, &ldquo;autant de

<p>Pinheiro da Veiga, in his queer <i>Pincigraphia</i>,
or &ldquo;Description and Natural and Moral History
of Valladolid,&rdquo; written earlier in the same century,
and published twenty years ago by Gayangos
from a manuscript in the British Museum, is
more plain-spoken than the Frenchman on the
various merits and peculiarities of the Spanish
balconies and <i>rejas</i>. &ldquo;All of these churches have
the most beautiful iron balustrades and iron open-work
doors (<i>cancelas</i>) that can be found in Europe,
for nowhere is iron worked so skilfully as here
in Valladolid. These objects are made by the
Moriscos with turned balusters, foliage, boughs,
fruits, war-material, trophies, and other contrivances,
which afterwards they gild and silver
into the very likeness of these metals. I say
the same of window-balconies; for nearly every
window has its balcony. There are in Valladolid
houses up which one might clamber to
the very roof from balcony to balcony, as
though these were a hand-ladder. So too from
balcony to balcony (for the distance from one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
other is never greater than a palm's breadth)
one might climb round the whole Plaza. By
reason of this, we Portuguese were wont to say
that if there were as many thieves or lovers in
Valladolid as in Portugal, verily both one and
other of this kind of folks would have but little
need of hand-ladders. Yet here the thieves content
themselves with stealing by the light of day,
while as for the women (crafty creatures that
they are!), they perpetrate their thefts away
from home; and, having all the day at their
disposal, prefer to thieve while daylight lasts,
rather than pass the night uncomfortably. To
this I heard a lady of Castile declare, when one of
my friends, a Portuguese, petitioned her for leave
to speak with her at night across her <i>reja</i>: &lsquo;That
would be tantamount to passing from one <i>hierro</i>
to another <i>yerro</i>;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and in my house (which is
also your worship's) it would not look well for
you to seem a window-climbing thief.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>It is curious, in the foregoing narrative, to read
of Morisco craftsmen working as late as 1600, and
as far north as Castile. Perhaps the notice of
Moriscos doing Spanish iron-work may be traced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to certain Ordinances of Granada, published
about three-quarters of a century before. On
October 14th, 1522, the councillors of that town
confabulated very lengthily and seriously as to
the damage caused by &ldquo;balconies and <i>rejas</i>
in the streets, fixed in the basements and the
lower rooms of houses, or projecting portals which
extend beyond the level of the wall. For we
have witnessed, and do witness daily, numerous
mishaps to wayfarers, alike on horseback and on
foot, whether by day or night, because the
highways, narrow in themselves, are rendered
yet more narrow by such balconies and <i>rejas</i>.
Whereas in winter persons seeking to escape
the filth by keeping to the wall are thwarted, or
at night-time injured, by these <i>rejas</i>. Or yet in
summer, when the waters swell, and conduits
burst and overflow the middle of the street, then
neither can they keep the middle of the way, nor
pass aside (by reason of the balconies aforesaid)
to its edges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having regard to all these grievances, the
councillors decreed that &ldquo;none of whatsoever
order or condition shall dare henceforth to
place, or cause to be placed, about the lower
floors or entrance of their dwelling, <i>rejas</i> or iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
balconies, or anything projecting much or little
from the level of the wall. But all projections
shall be set three yards, not any less, above the
street. If not so much, they shall be set within
the wall, on pain of a fine of ten thousand
<i>maravedis</i>, and five thousand <i>maravedis</i> to the
mason and the carpenter that shall repair their
fixing. Further, we order that all balconies and
<i>rejas</i> now at a height of less than the aforesaid
three yards be taken away within three days
from the crying in public of these Ordinances.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>For this deplorable state of things a double
influence was to blame; namely, the oriental
narrowness of the street, and also the elaborate
ornamentation, proceeding very largely from a
northern Gothic and non-Spanish source, of these
annoying yet impressive gratings. Some of them,
sweeping the very soil, and boldly and fantastically
curved, may yet be seen at Toro. Those of
Granada are no more. Indeed, not only have the
<i>rejas</i> of the Spanish private house long ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to show the decorative cunning of the craftsman,
but even in their present unartistic form are
largely limited to Andalusia. Yet even thus, they
seem to guard a typical and national air, mixed
with a subtle, semi-Mussulmanic poetry. Across
them, while the term of courtship lasts, the lover
whispers with his mistress, oblivious of the outer
world, fixing his gaze within, until his sultaness
emerges from the gloom, and holds his hand,
and looks into his eyes, and listens to his vow.
Therefore, in &ldquo;April's ivory moonlight,&rdquo; beneath
the velvet skies of Andalusia, one always is well
pleased to pass beside these children of romantic
Spain, warming the frigid iron with the breath of
youth, and hope, and happiness, and telling to
each other a secret that is known unto us all&mdash;at
once the sweetest and the saddest, the newest and
the oldest story of all stories.</p>

iron rings, bracelets, brooches, and other ornaments, is preserved
in the Schools of Aguirre at Madrid. Villa-amil y Castro (<i>Antigüedades

iron objects of uncertain use discovered in Galicia, together with
spear-heads and other weapons or pieces of weapons which will
be noticed under <i>Arms</i>, and also an object which he says may
once have been a candlestick, or else a kind of flute. All
these are probably pre-Roman. Dating from the Roman period
are an iron ploughshare and some sickles, discovered at Ronda
in Andalusia, and now in the Madrid Museum. Góngora, however
(<i>Antigüedades prehistóricas de Andalucía</i>), inclines to think
that previous to the Roman conquest the occupants of Betica
were ignorant of this metal, though not of gold, from which they
fashioned diadems and other articles of wear. See also Caballero

have seen the inlaid iron-work of Eibar and Toledo. The objects
chiefly manufactured in this style are brooches, bracelets, scarf
and hat pins, photograph frames, jewel and trinket boxes, watches,
and cigarette cases. The workmanship is often elaborate and
costly, nor can it be denied that the red or greenish gold has an
effective look against the jet-black surface of the polished or unpolished
iron. Upon the other hand, the taste displayed in the
design is seldom good; while in a climate with the slightest tendency
to damp, the iron is apt to rust and tarnish, and the fine inlay to
loosen.</p></div>

<p>The earliest objects of bronze discovered in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
country are comparatively few. As in other parts
of Europe, they consist mostly of weapons, such as
spear-heads and hatchets (which will be noticed
under <i>Arms</i>), or bracelets, necklaces, and clasps or
brooches. Earrings (<i>inaures</i>), brooches (<i>fibulæ</i>),
and other objects of a similar purpose dating from
the Roman period have been discovered in Galicia,
while plates of the same alloy<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> which imitate a
shell were used as personal ornaments by the
men and women of the ancient Spanish tribes.</p>

<p>The province of Palencia is a fertile field for
archæological discovery. Here have been found
some curious clasps, intended, it would seem, to
represent the old Iberian mounted warrior, sometimes
brandishing the typical Iberian lance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>

<p>Two parts&mdash;the figure of the horseman, and a
four-wheeled stand on which the warrior's steed
is resolutely set&mdash;compose this comical antiquity.
The rider's only article of clothing is a helmet;
while the horse, without a saddle or a bridle, is

</div>

<p>We know that the use of Roman lamps grew to
be general in this land&mdash;a fact which justifies my
noticing the specimens preserved in the museum
of Madrid; and more particularly so because their
shape and general character have been perpetuated
through the Spanish Moors and Christians
of the Middle Ages till this very moment.</p>

<p>The Roman lamp, shaped somewhat like a boat
by reason of the <i>rostrum</i> or beakish receptacle for
the wick, consisted of an earthenware or metal
vessel with a circular or oblong body and a handle,
together with at least one hole for pouring in the
oil. The commonest material was earthenware,
and next to this, bronze. The lamp was either
suspended by a chain or chains, or else was rested
on a stand. Plato and Petronius tell us that the
stand was borrowed from the rustic makeshift of
a stick, or the stout stem of a plant, thrust into
the ground. As time went on, the stem or stick
in imitative metal-work was rendered more or less
artistic and ornate. But there was more than
a single kind of lampstand. The <i>lychnuchus</i>
(&#955;&#965;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#962;), invented by the Greeks, held various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
lamps suspended from its branches, while, on
the other hand, the Roman <i>candelabrum</i> supported
but a solitary lamp upon the disc or platform
at its top extremity.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The island of Egina
was famed for the production of these discs, and
Pliny tells us that the decorated stem or <i>scapus</i>
was chiefly manufactured at Tarentum.</p>

<p>The Roman lampstands also varied in their
height. When the stem was long they stood upon
the ground&mdash;a fashion we have seen revived in
recent years, and even where electricity replaces
oil. When, on the contrary, the stem was short,
the stand was known as a <i>candelabrum humile</i>,
and rested on a table or a stool.</p>

<p class="caption">A <i>CANDIL</i><br />

</div>

<p>The Madrid Museum contains a remarkable
bronze lamp in the form of an ass's head adorned
with flowers and with ivy. The ass is holding in
its mouth the <i>rostrum</i> for the wick. The hole for
the oil is shaped like a flower with eleven petals,
under one of which is the monogram M&#8224;R. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
back of this lamp consists of an uncouth human
male figure, in a reclining posture, wearing a
Phrygian cap and holding the ass's head between
his legs.</p>

<p>Other lamps of bronze, including several of an
interesting character, are in the same collection.
One of these represents a sea-deity; another has
its handle shaped like a horse's head and neck;
and in a third the orifice for the oil is heart-shaped,
while the handle terminates in the head of a swan.</p>

<p>There is also a series of three pensile lamps&mdash;two
in the likeness of the head and neck of a
griffin, and the third in that of a theatrical mask;
as well as a candelabrum fourteen inches high,
terminating beneath in three legs with lions' claws
(foreshadowing or repeating oriental motives), and
above in a two-handled vessel on which to place
the lamp. This vessel supports at present a fine
<i>lucerna</i> in the form of a peacock.</p>

<p>Probably no people in the world have kept
extant, or rather, kept alive, their oldest forms of
pottery or instruments for giving light more steadfastly
or more solicitously than the Spaniards.
Their iron <i>candil</i><a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and brass <i>velón</i> of nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>

lamp that rests upon a table or the ground&mdash;are
borrowed with but a minimum of alteration from
the lighting apparatus of the ancient Greeks and
Romans, and possess, for all their coarse and
cheap and unpretentious workmanship, a subtle
interest and elegance attributable only to the
inspiration of antiquity.</p>

<p>More than the shape of these old objects seems
to have passed to modern Spain&mdash;if any phase
at all of Spanish life can ever justly be accounted
modern. The ancients had an almost superstitious
reverence for a lighted lamp, and were
accustomed to declare that &ldquo;<i>lucerna, cum extinguitur,
vocem emittit, quasi necata</i>&rdquo;; &ldquo;a lamp,
on being put out, utters a sound as though it were
being murdered.&rdquo; Now, it may be a coincidence&mdash;although
I cannot but regard it as distinctly
more than a coincidence&mdash;that even at this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a large proportion of the Andalusian people are
markedly averse to blowing out a kindled match;
nor do they think it of good augury to be in a
room where three lights&mdash;candles, matches, or
whatever they may be&mdash;are simultaneously aflame.
I have noticed, too, that, whether from utter carelessness
or whether from ancestral superstition
handed down from Rome, one rarely sees upon
the staircase or the doorstep of a Spanish public
building a vesta that has been (if I may be
allowed the term) extinguished <i>artificially</i>.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In the Madrid Museum are several military
bronze <i>signa</i> which were found in Spain and date
from the Roman era, as well as a <i>vexillum</i>, or one
of the T-shaped frames on which the warriors of
that people used to hang their standards. One of
these <i>signa</i> is in the form of a wild boar; another
in that of a saddled and bridled horse. Beneath
this latter is the word VIVA and a cross, which
shows that the object dates from a period not
earlier than the reign of Constantine.</p>

<p>It is strange&mdash;or rather, would be strange in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
country that had been less constantly afflicted
both with civil and external warfare&mdash;that hardly
anything remains of all the bronze artistic objects
manufactured by the Spanish Moors. Poets of
this race have sung of gold and silver fountains,
door-knockers, and statues that adorned the buildings
of Cordova. In many of these instances the
hyperbolic gold and silver of the writers would
undoubtedly be bronze. Al-Makkari quotes an
Arab poet who extols in passionate terms
Almanzor's dazzling mansion of Az-zahyra.
&ldquo;Lions of metal,&rdquo; sang this poet, &ldquo;bite the
knockers of thy doors, and as those doors resound
appear to be exclaiming <i>Allahu akbar</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;God is
great&rdquo;). Another bard describes the fountains
of the same enchanted palace. &ldquo;The lions who
repose majestically in this home of princes, instead
of roaring, allow the waters to fall in murmuring
music from their mouths. <i>Their bodies seem to be
covered with gold</i>, and in their mouths crystal is
made liquid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though in reality these lions are at rest, they
seem to move and, when provoked, to grow
enraged. One would imagine that they remembered
their carnage of past days, and bellowing
turned once more to the attack.</p>

(<i>Found in the Province of Palencia</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;When the sun is reflected from their <i>bronze</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
surface, they seem to be of fire, with tongues of
flame that issue from their mouths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, when we observe them to be
vomiting water, one would think this water to be
swords which melt without the help of fire, and
are confounded with the crystal of the fountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Figures in bronze, of eagles, peacocks, swans,
stags, dragons, lions, and many other creatures
were set about in garden and in hall, to decorate
these splendid palaces of ancient Cordova.</p>

<p>A specimen of this class of objects is a bronze
lion of small dimensions (Plate <a href="#img_173.jpg">xxx</a>.) found not
many years ago in the province of Palencia, and
believed to date from the reign of Al-Hakem the
Second of Cordova. It belonged for some time
to the painter Fortuny&mdash;a diligent and lucky
hunter of antiquities,&mdash;and was subsequently purchased
in 1875 by M. Piot. The modelling and
decoration of this beast, especially the mannered
and symmetrical curls which are supposed to form
its mane, are quite conventional and strongly reminiscent
of Assyrian art, such as pervades the
various lions rudely wrought in stone and still
existing at Granada; whether the celebrated
dozen that support and guard the fountain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the courtyard of the Moorish palace,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> or else the
greater pair of grinning brutes proceeding from
the ruins of the palace of Azaque (miscalled the
Moorish Mint), which may be noticed squatting
with their rumps towards the road, beside the
garden entrance to the Carmen de la Mezquita.</p>

<p>This little bronze lion measures about twelve
inches high by fourteen inches long. The legs
and part of the body are covered with a pattern
representing flowers. The mane is described by
comma-shaped marks. The tail, bent not ungracefully
along the animal's back, is decorated
with a kind of plait through nearly all its length.
The eyes are now two cavities, but seem in other
days to have contained two coloured stones or
gems. Upon the back and flanks is a Cufic
inscription which says, &ldquo;<i>Perfect blessing. Complete
happiness.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mussulman historians have described, in terms
of cloying praise, the &ldquo;red gold animals contrived
with subtle skill and spread with precious stones&rdquo;
which Abderrahman placed at Cordova upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
fountains of his palaces. &ldquo;Rivers of water
issued from the mouth of every animal, and
fell into a jasper basin.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;red gold&rdquo;
are patently an oriental term for bronze. In
view of this, and of the fact that the lion of
Palencia is hollow-bellied, with his mouth wide
open for ejecting water, and with a tail of cunning
craftsmanship, which would avail, on being
rotated, to produce or check the current of the
&ldquo;liquid crystal,&rdquo; we may conclude that it was
intended both to form a part of, and to decorate
a Moorish fountain of old days, and is the kind
of beast &ldquo;with precious stones for eyes&rdquo; so
often and so ecstatically lauded by the Muslim
writers.</p>

<p>Similar to the foregoing object, and dating from
about the same period, is a small bronze stag
(Pl. <a href="#img_173.jpg">xxxi</a>.) in the provincial museum of Cordova. It
is believed to proceed originally from the famous
palace (tenth century) of Az-zahra, and used to be
kept, some centuries ago, in the convent of San
Jerónimo de Valparaiso.</p>

<p>The museum of Granada contains some interesting
Moorish bronzes, found on the site of the
ancient city of Illiberis, abandoned by its occupants
on their removal to Granada at the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of the eleventh century. The most remarkable
of these discoveries are pieces of a fountain, a
small temple (Plate <a href="#img_174.jpg">xxxii</a>.), an <i>almirez</i> or mortar
(Plate <a href="#img_176.jpg">xxxiii</a>.), similar to one (not mentioned by
Riaño) which was discovered at Monzón, and a
few lamps. The fragments of a fountain end in
the characteristic Assyrian-looking lions' heads,
with lines in regular zones to represent the eyes
and other features. One of the lamps (Pl. <a href="#img_176.jpg">xxxiii</a>.)
is far superior to the rest. Notwithstanding
Riaño's assertion that all of these antiquities are
&ldquo;incomplete and mutilated,&rdquo; this lamp is well
preserved, and still retains, secured by a chain,
the little metal trimming-piece or <i>emunctorium</i>
of the Romans. The small bronze temple is
sometimes thought (but this hypothesis seems
rather fanciful) to be a case, or part of a case,
designed for keeping jewellery. The height of it
is two-and-twenty inches, and the form hexagonal,
&ldquo;with twelve small columns supporting bands of
open work, frescoes, cupola, and turrets; in the
angles are birds&rdquo; (Riaño).</p>

<p>The most important object in this substance
now extant in any part of Spain is probably the
huge and finely decorated lamp of Mohammed the
Third of Granada (Pl. <a href="#img_179.jpg">xxxiv</a>.), called sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
&ldquo;the lamp of Oran,&rdquo; from a mistaken belief that
it had formed part of the booty yielded by this
city after her capture in 1509 by Cardinal Jimenez
de Cisneros.</p>

<p>The material of this lamp is bronze, possibly
provided by the bells of Christian churches taken
and pillaged by the Moors. It has four parts or
tiers of varying shape, delicately wrought in open-work,
and reaching a height of nearly seven feet in
all. The third and largest tier, corresponding to
the shade, is in the form of a truncated pyramid,
and shows a different design on each of its four
sides. The lamp bears several inscriptions, interrupted
here and there through breakage of the
metal. The longest of these legends is interpreted
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of God the Merciful. (May) the
blessing of God be on our lord Mohammed and his
kin; health and peace. (This lamp) was ordered
(to be made) by our Lord the egregious sultan,
the favoured, the victorious, the just, the happy,
the conqueror of cities, and the extreme boundary
of just conduct among the servants (of God); the
emir of the Mussulmans Abu-Abdillah, son of our
lord the emir of the Mussulmans Abu-Abdillah,
son of our lord Al-Galib-Billah, the conqueror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
through God's protection, the emir of the Mussulmans
Abu-Abdillah; (may) God aid him (praised
be God).&rdquo; Here is a breakage and a corresponding
gap in the inscription, which continues, &ldquo;beneath
it, lighted by my light for its magnificence
and the care of its <i>xeque</i>, with righteous purpose
and unerring certainty. And this was in the
month of Rabié the first blessed, in the year 705.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
May (God) be praised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The history of this lamp has been explored with
scholarly care by Rodrigo Amador de los Ríos,
whose monograph will be found in the <i>Museo
Español de Antigüedades</i>. He says that the lamp
was formerly suspended from the ceiling of the
chapel of San Ildefonso in the university of Alcalá
de Henares. Here, too, he has discovered entries
which relate to it in two separate inventories, dated
1526 and 1531, from which we gather that the
lamp, excepting the lowest part or tier, which
probably proceeded from Oran, was brought to
Alcalá by Cardinal Cisneros from the mosque of
the Alhambra of Granada.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">MOORISH LAMP AND MORTAR<br />
(<i>Moorish. Museum of Granada</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>All of the lamp (continues Amador) that
properly belongs to it, is the open-work shade,
together with the graduated set of spheres which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
we now observe on top.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The lowest part is
clearly an inverted bell, from which project four
decorative pieces. This is believed by Amador
to be a Spanish bell, dating from the fifteenth
century, designed for striking with a hammer,
and proceeding from some monastery or convent
plundered by the Moors. Indeed, one of the two
inventories discovered at Alcalá mentions &ldquo;a bell
with a hole in it, <i>which used to belong to a Moorish
lamp</i>,&rdquo; thus countenancing the widespread supposition
that the lamps of the mosque of Cordova
were made of the Christian bells of Compostela,
which the fierce Almanzor caused to be conveyed
upon the aching backs of Christian captives to the
Moorish court and capital of Andalusia.</p>

<p>It is probable, therefore, that the lamp of the
third Mohammed of Granada is now composed
of two lamps, and that the primitive arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of its parts was altered by the ignorant. Eight
chains would formerly suspend it, in the following
order of its tiers or stages, from the dome of the
<i>mezquita</i>. First and uppermost would come the
shade; then, next to this, the set of tapering
spheres; and, last and lowest, the saucer or <i>platillo</i>,
which has disappeared. Further, and as Koranic
law prescribed, the lamp would hold two lights&mdash;one
to be kindled on the saucer, and the other
underneath the shade.</p>

<p>Other articles of Spanish-Moorish ornamented
bronze are thimbles, buckets, and the spherical
perfume-burners which were used to roll upon
the stone or marble pavement of a dwelling.
Moorish thimbles, conical and uncouthly large,
are not uncommonly met with at Granada. I
have one, of which the above is an outline
sketched to size.</p>

<p>Sometimes these Moorish thimbles are inscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in Cufic lettering with phrases such as&mdash;&ldquo;(May)
the blessing of God and every kind of happiness
(be destined for the owner of this thimble)&rdquo;; or
else the maker's name&mdash;&ldquo;The work of Saif&rdquo;; or
a single word&mdash;&ldquo;Blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thimbles from which I quote these legends
are in the National Museum. The same collection
includes a very finely wrought bronze bucket or
<i>acetre</i> (Latin <i>situlus</i>; Arabic <i>as-setl</i>, the utensil
for drawing water for a bath). The outside is
covered with delicate ornamentation, varied with
inscriptions of no great interest, invoking Allah's
blessing on the owner or employer of the bucket,
which is thought by Amador to be of Granadino
workmanship, and to date from about the middle
of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Not many specimens remain of early mediæval
Spanish bronzes wrought by Christian hands.
Riaño, who admits that &ldquo;we can hardly trace
any bronze of this period other than cathedral
bells,&rdquo; mentions as probably proceeding from
abroad the altar-fronts and statuettes, in gilt
enamelled bronze, of Salamanca and elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
and gives a short description of the bell, about
six inches high (Pl. <a href="#img_180.jpg">xxxv</a>.), known as the Abbot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Samson's, now in Cordova Museum. This object
bears an early date (875 A.D.), and is inscribed,
&ldquo;<i>Offert hoc munus Samson abbatis in domum Sancti
Sebastiani martyris Christi, Era</i> D.C.C.C.C.XIII.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is curious that Riaño should make no mention
of Spanish bronze processional crosses. In my
chapter on gold, silver, and jewel work I mentioned
those belonging to churches in the north of Spain.
A bronze crucifix (Plate <a href="#img_182.jpg">xxxvi</a>.), believed to date
from the beginning of the twelfth century, and
proceeding from the monastery of Arbós, in the
province of León, is now in the possession of Don
Felix Granda Builla. It is undoubtedly of
Spanish make, and probably was carried in processions.
The style is pure Romanic, and the
drawing of the ribs, extremities, and limbs is
typically primitive. The <i>sudarium</i> is secured by
the belt or <i>parazonium</i>. The feet, unpierced, rest
on a <i>supedaneum</i>.</p>

<p>A bronze Renaissance parish cross of the
sixteenth century, once hidden in a village of
Asturias, was bought some thirty years ago by
the museum of Madrid. The body of the cross
is wood, covered on both sides with bronze plates
wrought with figures of the Saviour as the holy
infant and as full-grown man, and also with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
figure of the Virgin. These figures were formerly
painted, and traces of the colour yet remain. The
cross was also silvered. The rest of the ornamentation
consists of vases, flowers, and other subjects
proper to Renaissance art.</p>

<p>A similar cross belongs to the parish church of
San Julian de Recaré, in the province of Lugo,
while San Pedro de Donas, near Santiago in
Galicia, possesses a processional cross of bronze,
pierced along the edges in a pattern of trefoils
and <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, but otherwise undecorated.</p>

<p>Sometimes in Spanish bronze we find the
handiwork of Moors and Christians picturesquely
intermingled, as in the gates of Toledo cathedral
(1337), and the Puertas del Perdón&mdash;forming the
principal entrance to the Court of Orange Trees&mdash;of
the mosque of Cordova, made of wood and
covered with bronze plating decorated with
irregular hexagons and Gothic and Arabic inscriptions.
The knockers contain a scroll and
flowers, and on the scroll the words, <i>Benedictus
Dominus Deus Israel</i>. The gate of the same
name of Seville cathedral (Pl. <a href="#img_184.jpg">xxxvii</a>.) is similar
in workmanship, and is considered by Riaño to
be a good example of Moresque bronze-work.</p>

<p>While speaking of these doors, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
remember that Moorish craftsmen were employed
to decorate or to repair the mosque of Cordova
long after it had been converted to the worship
of the Christians. When he was acting as viceroy
in the year 1275, the Infante Don Fernando
confirmed a letter of his father, King Alfonso,
remitting tolls and taxes that would otherwise be
leviable upon four Moors who worked in the
cathedral. The Infante's confirmation, after recording
that &ldquo;one (of the four Moors) is dead and
the other blind, in such wise that he can work no
more,&rdquo; consents to the engagement of another two,
Famet and Zahec by name, to fill their places,
and who also are hereby exempted from the
payment of all dues. Five years afterwards this
privilege was reconfirmed by King Alfonso, and
we are further told on this occasion that two of
the Moorish four were <i>albañís</i>, or masons, and the
others <i>añaiares</i>, or carpenters. As time progressed,
the situation of the vanquished and humiliated
Mussulmans grew more irksome. On October
25th, 1320, the Infante Don Sancho, who had
usurped the throne, proclaimed, in ratification of a
letter issued by his father, that all the Moorish
carpenters, masons, sawyers, and other workmen
and artificers of Cordova must work in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
cathedral (presumably without a wage) for two
days in every year.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>In the latter half of the sixteenth century,
Bartolomé Morel, a Sevillano, produced some
notable work in bronze.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Three objects by his
hand&mdash;namely, the choir lectern and the tenebrarium
of Seville cathedral, and the weathercock
or <i>Giraldillo</i> which crowns the celebrated tower of
the same enormous temple&mdash;are specially distinguished
for their vigour and effectiveness.</p>

<p>The least important of these objects is the
choir lectern, for which Morel was paid six
hundred ducats. The decoration is of statuettes
and <i>rilievi</i>, well designed and better executed.
The tenebrarium, aptly defined by Amador as
&ldquo;an article of church furniture intended to make
a show of light,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> is more ambitious and original.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
&ldquo;It was designed and made by Morel in the year
1562. Juan Giralte, a native of Flanders, and Juan
Bautista Vazquez helped him to make the statues
at the head of this candelabrum, and Pedro
Delgado, another noted sculptor of Seville, worked
at the foot of it. It is eight and a half yards high,
and the triangular head is three yards across.
Upon this upper part are fifteen statues, representing
the Saviour, the apostles, and two other
disciples or evangelists. In the vacant space of
the triangle is a circle adorned with leaves, and in
the centre of this circle is a bust of the Virgin in
relief, and, lower down, the figure of a king. All
of this part is of bronzed wood, and rests upon
four small bronze columns. The remainder of the
candelabrum is all of this material, and the small
columns are supported by four caryatides, resting
upon an order of noble design decorated with lions'
heads, scrolls, pendants, and other ornamentation,
the whole resting upon a graceful border enriched
with harpies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This description of the Seville tenebrarium is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
translated from Cean Bermudez, and is the one
most commonly quoted, though Amador complains
that it is not precise, and fails to dwell upon the
symbolism of this mighty mass of bronze.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Thus,
what Cean affirms to be the bust of a king is
declared by Amador to be the head of a pope,
probably Saint Gregory the Great. Metal, as
Cean remarks, is not employed throughout. In
order to preserve its balance, the upper part of the
tenebrarium, containing the triangle which is said
by some to symbolize &ldquo;the divinity of Jesus as
God the triple and the one,&rdquo; is merely wood
bronzed over. Amador adds that the foot and
stem are intended to represent &ldquo;the people of
Israel in their perfidy and ingratitude.&rdquo; He also
says that the statue in the centre of the triangle is
that of Faith, and that which crowns the entire
tenebrarium, of the Virgin Mary.</p>

instead of paying him the stipulated price, namely,
eight hundred ducats, they added of their own

also commissioned him to make a handsome case
to keep it in; but the case has disappeared, and
the naked tenebrarium now stands in the Sacristy
of Chalices of the cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It is still used

<p>The title of the object which surmounts the
famed Giralda tower of Seville is properly &ldquo;the
Statue of Faith, the triumph of the Church&rdquo; (Pl. <a href="#img_186.jpg">xxxviii</a>.);
but it is known in common language
as the Giraldillo (weathercock), which name has
passed into the word Giralda, now applied to all
the tower. The populace of Seville also call it,
in the <i>argot</i> of their cheerful town, the <i>muñeco</i>
or &ldquo;doll,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Victory,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Santa Juana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This statue, made of hollow bronze, rotates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
upon an iron rod piercing the great bronze globe
which lies immediately beneath the figure's feet.
The globe is nearly six feet in diameter. The
figure itself represents a Roman matron wearing
a flowing tunic partly covering her legs and arms.
Sandals are secured to her feet by straps.
Upon her head she wears a Roman helmet
crested by a triple plume. In her right hand
she holds the semicircular Roman standard
of the time of Constantine, which points the
direction of the wind and causes the figure to
revolve, excepting when the air is very faint, in
which case it is caught by two diminutive banners
springing from the large one.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> So huge are the
proportions of this metal lady that the medal
on her breast contains a life-size head which
represents an angel.</p>

<p>The Spanish Moors were also well acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
with the use of weathercocks. During the reign,
in the eleventh century, of the Zirite kingling
of Granada, Badis ben Habbus, a weathercock
of strange design surmounted his <i>alcázar</i>. The
historian Marmol wrote in the sixteenth century
that it was still existing on a little tower, and
consisted of a horseman in Moorish dress, with
a long lance and his shield upon his arm, the
whole of bronze, with an inscription on the shield
which says: &ldquo;Badis ben Habbus declares that in
this attitude should the Andalusian be discovered
(at his post).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not many other objects in this substance can
be instanced as the work of Spanish craftsmen of
the sixteenth and succeeding centuries, or of the
later-Gothic age immediately preceding. Among
them are the pulpits of Santiago cathedral, made
by Celma, an Aragonese, in 1563; the choir-screen
(1574&ndash;1579) in the cathedral of Zaragoza,
made by Juan Tomás Cela, also a native of
Aragon; the gilt lecterns of Toledo cathedral,
which are the work of Nicolás Vergara and his
son; the Gothic lectern of the mosque of Cordova;
the choir-lectern (1557) of Cuenca, made by Hernando
de Arenas, who will also be remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
as having made the <i>reja</i> of the same cathedral;
and the octagonal gilt-bronze pulpits of Toledo,
wrought by Francisco de Villalpando, as are the
bas-reliefs (1564) upon the door of Lions, executed
by the same craftsman from designs by
Berruguete.</p>

<p>These last-named pulpits are associated with a
legend. Within this temple, once upon a time,
rested the metal sepulchre of the great Don
Alvaro de Luna, so constructed by his orders that
upon the touching of a secret spring the statue of
the Constable himself would rise into a kneeling
posture throughout the celebration of the mass.
His lifelong and relentless foe, the Infante Enrique
of Aragon, tore up the tomb in 1449; and from
its fragments, superstition says, were made these
pulpits.</p>

<p>Spanish Renaissance door-knockers in bronze
are often curious. Fifteen large bronze rings
adorned with garlands, heads of lions and of
eagles, or with the pair of columns and the motto
<span class="smcap">PLUS OULTRE</span> of Charles the Fifth, were formerly
upon the pilasters of the roofless, semi-ruined
palace of that emperor at Granada. Removed
elsewhere for greater safety,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> they will now be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
found among the couple of dozen curiosities
preserved in a chamber of the Moorish royal
residence of the Alhambra.</p>

<p>Herewith I end my sketch of Spanish bronzes,
without delaying to describe the tasteless <i>transparente</i>
behind the altar of Toledo cathedral, or
the neo-classic, Frenchified productions of the
reign of Charles the Third, such as the table-mountings
of the Buen Retiro, or trifles from
the silver factory of Antonio Martinez. At the
Escorial, the shrine of the Sagrario de la Santa
Forma and the altar-front of the pantheon of the
kings of Spain, wrought by Fray Eugenio de la
Cruz, Fray Juan de la Concepción, and Fray
Marcos de Perpignan, are meritorious objects of
their time. But the history of Spanish bronzes
properly ends with the Renaissance. This material,
possibly from its cost, has not at any time been
greatly popular in Spain. Wood, plain or painted,
was preferred to bronze in nearly all her statuary.
Her mediæval and Renaissance <i>reja</i> and <i>custodia</i>
makers can challenge all the world. So can her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
potters, armourers, leather-workers, and wood-carvers.
But if we look for masterpieces in the
art of shaping bronze, our eyes must turn to Italy,
where, to astonish modern men, the powers of a
Donatello or Ghiberti vibrate across all ages in
the bas-reliefs of Saint Anthony at Padua, or in
the gates of the Baptistery of Florence.</p>

<p>Lovers of the old-time crafts approach a fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
field in Spanish arms; for truly with this warworn
land the sword and spear, obstinately
substituted for the plough, seem to have grown
well-nigh into her regular implements of daily
bread-winning; and from long before the age of
written chronicle her soil was planted with innumerable
weapons of her wrangling tribesmen.</p>

<p>The history of these ancient Spanish tribes is
both obscure and complicated. If Pliny, Strabo,
Ptolemy, and other authors may be credited, the
Celtic race invaded the Peninsula some seven
centuries before the Christian era, crossing the
river Ebro, founding settlements, and fusing with
the natives into the composite people known
henceforward as the Celtiberians. Thus strengthened,
they extended over nearly all the land, and
occupied, by a dominative or assimilative policy,
the regions corresponding to the modern Andalusia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Portugal, Galicia, and the flat and central
elevations of Castile.</p>

<p>These Spanish tribes were ever quarrelling,
and knew, in Strabo's words, &ldquo;no entertainment
save in horsemanship and in the exercise of arms.&rdquo;
Quantities of their weapons have been found all
over Spain, such as the heads of spears and
arrows, or the blades of daggers, hatchets, knives,
and swords. With these Iberian tribesmen, as
with other peoples of the ancient world, the truly
prehistoric age is that of stone; hence they
advanced to bronze, and finally to iron. Beuter,
the historian of Valencia, wrote in 1534 that near
to the town of Cariñena, in Aragon, on digging
out some earthen mounds the excavators came
upon enormous bones, flint lance and arrow heads,
and knives the size of half an ordinary sword;
all these in company with &ldquo;many skulls transfixed
by the said stones.&rdquo; In the collection at Madrid,
formed by Don Emilio Rotondo y Nicolau, these
primitive Spanish weapons number several
thousands; and many more are in the National
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Discoveries of ancient Spanish arms of bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
occur less often and in smaller quantities than
those of stone or iron. Bronze hatchets, principally
of the straight-edged class (<i>à bords droites</i>)
have been found in Galicia and certain other
provinces. Villa-amil y Castro describes a bronze
dagger of curious workmanship, which was found
in Galicia in 1869. The point of the blade is
missing. If this were included, the length of the
weapon would be about six inches.</p>

<p>Other examples, now in the Madrid Museum,
include two swords, two daggers, and two arrowheads.
The swords, sharp-pointed, narrow in the
blade, and used by preference for thrusting, were
found not far from Calatayud&mdash;the ancient town
renowned, as Roman Bilbilis, for weapons of incomparable
temper. The daggers were probably
used for fighting hand to hand.</p>

<p>At the time of the Roman invasion we find, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
course, the Spaniards using iron weapons. I
shall not tax the patience of my readers by
enumerating all these weapons. Their names
are many, and the comments and descriptions of
old authors which refer to them are constantly at
variance. Nevertheless, the sword most popular
with the Celtiberians at the period of the Roman
conquest seems to have been a broad, two-handed
weapon with a point and double edge, and therefore
serviceable both for cutting and for thrusting.
Another of the Celtiberian swords, called the
<i>falcata</i>, was of a sickle shape. It terminated in
the kind of point we commonly associate with
a scimitar, and which is found to-day in Spanish
knives produced at Albacete. One of these
swords, in good condition, is in the National
Museum. It has a single edge, upon the concave
side of the blade, and measures rather less
than two feet. Other weapons in common use
among the Celtiberians were an iron dart&mdash;the
<i>sannion</i> or <i>soliferrea</i>; the javelin; the lance&mdash;a
weapon so immemorially old in Spain that patriotic
writers trace its origin to the prehistoric town of
Lancia in Asturias; and the <i>trudes</i> or <i>bidente</i>, a
crescent blade mounted upon a pole, mentioned
by Strabo and Saint Isidore, and identical with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the cruel weapon used until about a quarter of
a century ago for houghing coward cattle in the
bull-ring.</p>

<p>Thus, when the Romans entered Spain the
natives of this country were experienced in the
use of arms, and made their own from such
materials as their own soil yielded. Their tempering
was excellent, for Diodorus Siculus tells us
that they had already discovered the secret of
burying the metal in order that the moisture of
the earth might eat away its baser portions.
Besides the ancient Bilbilis in Aragon, a Spanish
city famous for her faultless tempering of implements
and weapons was Toledo. Martial,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> the
most illustrious son of Bilbilis, has sung the
praises of the one; less celebrated poets, such
as Gracio Falisco, of the other.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Even the
armourers of Rome were found to be less skilful
and successful swordsmiths than the Spaniards;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
and so, before the second Punic War, the model<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
or the models of the Spanish sword had been
adopted by the Roman army.</p>

<p>Various of the native peoples of Iberia were
distinguished by a special instrument or mode of
fighting. Strabo says that the Iberians as a
general rule employed two lances and a sword.
Those of Lusitania were especially adroit in
hurling darts. Each of their warriors kept a
number of these darts contained within his shield.
Upon the head they wore a helmet of a primitive
pattern strapped beneath the chin. This helmet,
called the <i>bacula</i>, protected all the wearer's face,
and had a mitred shape, with three red feathers
on the crest. Together with these arms, the
Lusitanians used a copper-headed lance and the
typical form of Celtiberian sword. More singular
and celebrated in their mode of fighting were the
Balearic islanders, who carried, through persistent
exercise, the art of slinging stones and leaden
plummets to the utmost limit of perfection. The
beaches of these islands, we are told, abounded,
then as now, in small, smooth pebbles, &ldquo;weapons
of Nature's own contrivance,&rdquo; rarely suited to
the sling.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> These slings were of three patterns,
severally designed for near, far, and middling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
distances. The lead or stone projectile sometimes
weighed a pound. Accordingly&mdash;so strenuous
was their zeal to be unrivalled in the practice of
this arm&mdash;even as little children the Baleares
went without their dinner, till, with the formidable
<i>funda</i> in their hand, they struck the stick their
parents planted for them in the soil. Pliny and
Polybius, notwithstanding, state that the sling
itself was not indigenous in this region, but imported
from Ph&oelig;nicia. However this may be,
the islanders within a little time contributed to
swell the power of the Roman legions.</p>

<p>The Visigoths continued using many of the
Roman or Ibero-Roman arms. Nevertheless, the
solid armour of the Romans, such as their greaves
and thigh-pieces and breastplates, was now replaced
by primitive chain-mail resembling scales
of fishes. According to Saint Isidore, Procopius,
and other writers, the favourite weapons of the
Spanish Visigoths were the sword or <i>spatha</i>, long,
broad-bladed, with a double edge; the hatchet,
the bow, the sling, the lance, the scythe, the
mace, the <i>pilum</i> or javelin (used extensively in
Spain throughout the Middle Ages),<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the <i>dolon</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
dagger which concealed itself within a wooden
staff, and took the name of &ldquo;treacherous&rdquo; or
&ldquo;wily&rdquo; from this circumstance; and the <i>conto</i>, a
keenly pointed pike. We also find among the
military engines of the Visigoths the <i>balista</i>, for
hurling stones and darts of large size, and the
<i>ariete</i> or battering-ram, constructed from a gnarled
and powerful tree-trunk braced with iron and
suspended by a cable. Their defensive body-armour
consisted of a coat of mail composed of
bronze or iron scales, and called the <i>lóriga</i> or
<i>perpunte</i>. This was worn above the <i>thorachomachus</i>,
a kind of tunic made of felt, in order
to shield the body from the roughness of the
mail. Upon their heads they wore an ample
helmet.</p>

shield. García Llansó says, however, that the
nobles of this people wore close-fitting mail tunics
covered with steel scales, a kind of bronze bassinet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
tight breeches, and high boots, and carried, besides
the sword which was slung from their belts, a
large, oval shield.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>From about the time of the Moorish invasion, the
changes in the arms and armour of the Spaniards
coincided in the main with those in other parts of
western Europe. Nevertheless, as late as the
eleventh century the Spanish sword retained the
characteristic which had endeared it to the
Roman legionaries&mdash;namely, a hilt of small
dimensions and a broad and shortish blade. In
course of time the blade grows narrower and
begins to taper towards the point. The <i>quillons</i>
or crossbars (Spanish <i>arriaces</i>, from the Arabic
<i>arrias</i>, a sword-hilt) were originally straight or
semicircular, and ended in a knob (<i>manzana</i>,
literally &ldquo;apple&rdquo;; Latin <i>pomum</i>, English <i>pommel</i>).
Thus, in the <i>Poem of the Cid</i> we find the verse:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;<i>Las manzanas é los arriaces todos de oro son.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throughout these early times the scabbard was
of wood lined with leather or with velvet, and
strengthened and adorned with leather bands;
but when the owner was of high estate, it often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
bore enamels in the <i>cloisonné</i> style; that is,
with patches of the coloured, vitreous substance
bordered and fastened in by metal wire. In
Spain this style, undoubtedly of foreign origin,
was superseded in the thirteenth century by
<i>champlevé</i> enamelling, in which the enamel lies
within a hollowed ground.</p>

<p>Spanish mediæval weapons down to the
fourteenth century are specified in the <i>fuero</i> of
Cáceres and other documents contemporary with
their use. Next always in importance to the
sword we find the hatchet, lance, crossbow, and
mace. Montaner's <i>Chronicle of the Kings of
Aragon</i> tells us that the sovereign, mace in hand,
dealt one of his enemies &ldquo;such a blow upon his
iron hat that his brains came oozing out at his
ears.&rdquo; Covarrubias mentions a dart-shaped
missile called the <i>azcona</i>&mdash;a word which some
authorities derive from the Arabic, and others
from the Basque <i>gascona</i>, an arm employed by
the natives of Gascony. The former derivation
seems the likelier. The <i>fuero</i> of Cáceres
mentions the <i>tarágulo</i>, described by the Count
of Clonard as a kind of dagger; and at the close
of the thirteenth century appears in Spain the
poniard, which was called among the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<i>Panzerbrecher</i>, or &ldquo;breaker of cuirasses,&rdquo; and
among the French the <i>misericorde</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>fuero</i> of Cáceres tells us, furthermore,
what was the regular equipment of the Spanish
foot and mounted soldier of that period. &ldquo;Each
horseman shall go forth to battle with a shield,
a lance, a sword, and spurs; and he that carries
not all these shall pay each time five sheep wherewith
to feed the soldiers&hellip;. Each mounted man
or pawn that trotteth not or runneth not to quit
his town or village as he hears the call,&mdash;the
first shall have his horse's tail cut off; the other
shall have his beard clipped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Defensive arms included various kinds of
coverings for the head; the <i>lóriga</i> or covering
for the body, the <i>cálcias</i> or covering for the
legs, and the shield.</p>

<p>The <i>lóriga</i> (Latin <i>lorica</i>) was the ordinary
hauberk or shirt of mail, such as was worn all
over military Europe, made of rings or scales
sewed strongly on a linen or leather under-tunic
consisting of a single piece, and reaching to
the knee. The <i>Gran Conquista de Ultramar</i>
of Alfonso el Sabio also informs us that it was
tied at certain openings known as <i>ventanas</i>
(&ldquo;windows&rdquo;), and that the collar of the tunic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was called the <i>gorguera</i>. The resistance of the
Spanish <i>lóriga</i> to a pointed weapon does not
seem to have been great, for the Chronicle of
the Monk of Silos says that at the siege of
Viseo the arrows of the Moorish bowmen went
through the triple <i>lórigas</i> of their foe.</p>

<p>Towards the twelfth century the custom arose
of wearing over the coat of mail a loose, sleeveless
frock (the <i>Waffenrock</i> of Germany), woven
of linen or some other light material, painted
or embroidered with the owner's arms. As
the Count of Clonard observes, it is clearly
this kind of frock that is referred to in the
following passage of the <i>Leyes de Partida</i>:
&ldquo;For some (of the knights) placed upon the
armour carried by themselves and by their
horses,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> signs that were different one from
another, in order to be known thereby; while
others placed them on their heads, or on their
helmets.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">THE BATTLE OF LA HIGUERUELA<br />
(<i>Wall painting. Hall of Battles, El Escorial</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The Normans used a form of hauberk with
attached mail-stockings. In Spain we find in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
lieu of this leg-covering, the Roman <i>cálcia</i> (Latin
<i>caliga</i>), extending from the foot to just below the
thigh, and subsequently called the <i>brafonera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
This was, in fact, a separate mail-stocking, made
of closely interlacing steel rings, and worn above
the leather boots or <i>trebuqueras</i>.</p>

<p>The Spanish <i>escudo</i> or shield was usually made
of wood covered with leather, and painted with
the arms or the distinguishing emblem of its lord.
Sometimes it was made of parchment. Thus the
Chronicle of the Cid informs us that this hero
after death was equipped with &ldquo;a painted parchment
helm and with a shield in the same wise.&rdquo;
Another form of Spanish shield, the <i>adarga</i>
(<i>atareca</i>, <i>atarca</i>; Arabic <i>ad-darka</i>, to hold upon
the arm), of which I shall subsequently notice
specimens in the Royal Armoury, was commonly
in the shape of a rough oval or of a heart, and
made of various folds of leather sewn and glued
together. The Chronicle of Alfonso the Eleventh
speaks of a certain famine which broke out among
the Spanish troops, and caused them such privation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that &ldquo;they chewed the leather of their
shields.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The battle headgear of this people passed
through many changes. &ldquo;The helmet of the
eighth century,&rdquo; says the Count of Clonard,
&ldquo;was the same which had been used by the
Cantabrians and Vascones before the general
peace proclaimed by Augustus Cæsar. Helmets
of this design are engraved upon the medals
(reproduced by Florez) of the imperial legate
Publius Carisius. They covered the entire head
and face, leaving only two holes for the eyes, as
we see upon the carved stone fragments in relief
at the door of the church of San Pedro de
Villanueva, representing the struggle of King
Froila with a bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another form of helmet which the Spaniards
began to use about this time was the <i>almofar</i>
(Arabic <i>al-mejfar</i>), made of iron scales. It
covered all the head, with the exception of the
eyes, nose, and mouth, and corresponds to the
<i>camail</i> of the Normans. Beneath it was worn
the linen <i>cofia</i>, a kind of bag or cap in which
the warrior gathered up his hair. After about
another century a round or conical iron helmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
(<i>capacete</i>), fitted with cheek-pieces, was superposed
on the <i>almofar</i> and fastened round the
chin with straps. The <i>capacete</i> of a noble was
often adorned with precious stones and coronets
of pure gold, while a spike projecting from the
top was tipped with a large carbuncle, in order to
catch and to reflect the flashing sunbeams.</p>

<p>The substitution for this spike of multiform and
multicolor figures or devices dates from a later
age. The Chronicle of Alfonso the Eleventh
describes as something altogether novel and surprising,
the crests upon the helmets of the foreign
knights who flocked, in 1343, to Algeciras to
aid the cause of Christianity against the Moor.
&ldquo;All of them,&rdquo; says this narrative, &ldquo;placed their
helmets at the door of their dwellings, supporting
them on stout and lofty staves; and the figures
on the helmets were of many kinds. On some
was the figure of a lion; on others that of a wolf,
or ass's head, or ox, or dog, or divers other
beasts; while others bore the likeness of the
heads of men; faces, beards, and all. Others,
too, had wings as those of eagles or of crows;
and so, between these various kinds there were
in all as many as six hundred helmets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This brings us to the celebrated helmet or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
<i>cimera</i> (Plate <a href="#img_198.jpg">xxxix</a>.), now in the Royal Armoury
of Madrid, believed till recently to have belonged
to Jayme the First, conqueror of Palma and
Valencia, and the greatest, both in spirit and in
stature, of the old-time kings of Aragon.</p>

<p>Such part of this interesting helmet as is left
consists of two pieces, one of them resting loosely
on the other. Baron de las Cuatro Torres infers,
from a detail which will presently be noted, that
the lower of these two pieces is not original; and
his opinion was shared by the Count of Valencia
de Don Juan, who, notwithstanding, thought the
spurious part to be coeval with the actual crest.
The upper part consists of a fragment of a helm,
made, like some flimsy theatre property, of linen,
card, and parchment, and surmounted with the
figure of the mythical monster known in the
Lemosin language as the <i>drac-pennat</i>, or winged
dragon, which formed, conjointly with the royal
crown, the emblem or device of all the Aragonese
sovereigns from Pedro the Fourth to Ferdinand
the Second.</p>

<p class="caption">PARADE HARNESS OF PHILIP THE THIRD<br />

</div>

<p>There is, however, no reason to doubt the
helmet's authenticity. It is known to have
remained for centuries at Palma, in the Balearics,
where it was worn upon the day of Saint Sylvester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in each year, by a person who walked in the procession
of the <i>Standart</i> to celebrate the capture
of the city by Don Jayme. This would explain
the lower piece contrived and added to the crest
itself, in order to adjust the incomplete and upper
portion to the subsequent wearer's head. The
helmet as originally made was meant for tourneying
only, and is therefore fashioned, not of metal,
but of the frail theatrical materials I have stated.
Copper and wood, says Viollet-le-Duc, were
also used in making these objects. The earliest
wearer of the helm cannot have been Don Jayme.
Baron de las Cuatro Torres remarks that on
an Aragonese coin of the reign of Pedro the
Fourth, the monarch is wearing on his head
something which looks identical with this <i>cimera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Demay has further told us that the vogue of
such <i>cimeras</i>, whose principal purpose was to
distinguish seigniories, lasted from 1289 till the
introduction of movable visors at the end of the
fourteenth or the beginning of the fifteenth
century. The present helmet, therefore, probably
belonged to Don Pedro the Fourth of
Aragon (&ldquo;the Ceremonious&rdquo;), and was made at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
some time in his reign&mdash;that is, between 1335
and 1387. A document has been discovered in
which this monarch's son, Don Martin of Aragon,
commands that year by year his own helmet,
&ldquo;<i>nostram emprissiam sive cimbram</i>,&rdquo; together
with the banner of Jayme the Conqueror, is to
be publicly exhibited in commemoration of the
capture of Majorca. Therefore we may conclude
from these important facts that here is the crest
of a tourneying helmet which belonged either
to Don Pedro the Fourth of Aragon, or else to
either of, or possibly both, his sons, Don Juan
and Don Martin.</p>

<p>The changes which occur in Spanish arms and
armour between the fourteenth and the sixteenth
centuries keep pace, upon the whole, with those in
other parts of Europe. It is, however, opportune
to notice how the Spanish armies of this time were
organized. Their regular cavalry consisted of:
(1) the force directly mustered by the king and
under his immediate leadership; (2) the mounted
burghers who defrayed the whole or part of their
expenses, being in certain instances assisted by a
stipend which had been created by municipal and
local <i>fueros</i>; (3) the knights belonging to the
military orders; and (4) the barons, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the men these last were called upon, obedient to
the summons of the royal <i>mandadero</i> (messenger),
to mount, equip, provision, and bring to war with
them. Such was the heavy cavalry of later mediæval
Spain. A lighter class, said by the Count of
Clonard to have been recruited from the southern
regions of the land, was known as <i>alfaraces</i>,
<i>almogávares</i>, or <i>omes de la gineta</i>.</p>

<p>These latter lived in frugal fashion. Water
was their only drink; bread and the roots of
plants their only food. Their clothing, too, was
of the slightest, consisting merely of a shirt, high
boots, and a kind of net upon the head. They
wore no armour, and carried as their only weapons
an <i>azagaya</i> and a lance. Their principal value was
in skirmishing.</p>

<p>The infantry were also of two kinds. The
first, collective or stipendiary, was levied by the
towns and cities, and from them received its maintenance.
The second was the <i>almogávares</i>, who
served for scouting, like their mounted comrades
of the same denomination. The stipendiary or
regular troops proceeded chiefly from the northern
provinces&mdash;Alava, Guipúzcoa, the Asturias, and
the mountains of León, and carried commonly the
lance, sword, sling, crossbow, and the <i>azagaya</i>&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
last a dart-shaped missile borrowed from the
Berber tribesmen,&mdash;the ancient Moorish <i>azgaya</i>,
the modern <i>assagai</i> or <i>assegai</i> of Zululand.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>In a country which was plunged in ruinous and
almost unremitting internecine strife; which was
(and is) inherently averse to commerce or to agriculture;
and where the bulk of all the national
wealth was either locked away in churches and in
convents, or in the coffers of great nobles who were
frequently as wealthy as, or even wealthier than,
the Crown, the armour of the common mediæval
Spanish soldier consisted of the plain and necessary
parts and nothing more. The aristocracy, upon
the other hand, often adorned their battle-harness
with the finest gold and silver work, and studded
it with precious stones. Even the esquires would
sometimes imitate their masters in this costly
mode. &ldquo;We command,&rdquo; said Juan the First in
one of his pragmatics dating from the end of the
fourteenth century, &ldquo;that no shield-bearer shall
carry cloth of gold or any manner of gold ornament
upon his trappings, scarf, or saddle; or on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
his badge or arms, excepting only on the edges of
his bassinet and his cuisses, together with the bit
and poitral of his horse, which may be gilded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is also evident from Royal Letters of this
time, that the kings of Spain depended very
largely for the flower of their forces on the private
fortune or resources of the Spanish noblemen
or even commoners; nor did they ever hesitate
to turn these means of other people to their
own particular good. The Ordinance of Juan
the First, dated Segovia, 1390, commands that,
&ldquo;Every man who possesses 20,000 <i>maravedis</i>
and upward shall have his proper set of harness,
habergeons and scale-pieces, and lappet-piece,
cuisses and vantbrasses, bassinet, camail, and
war-cap<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> with its gorget; or else a helmet, together
with sword and dagger, glaive and battle-axe.
And whoso possesses 3000 <i>maravedis</i> and
upward shall have his lance and javelin and shield,
his lappet-piece and coat of mail, and iron bassinet
without a camail, and a <i>capellina</i>, together with
his sword, <i>estoque</i>, and knife. And whoso has
between 2000 and 3000 <i>maravedis</i> shall have his
lance and sword or <i>estoque</i> and knife, or a bassinet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
or <i>capellina</i>, together with a shield. And whoso
has from 600 to 2000 <i>maravedis</i> shall have a
crossbow with its nut and cord and stirrup, quiver
and strap, and three dozen shafts. And whoso
has from 400 to 600 <i>maravedis</i> shall have a lance,
a javelin, and a shield. And whoso has 400
<i>maravedis</i> shall have a javelin and a lance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wealthier classes responded lavishly to
this command. Describing the battle of Olmedo
and the forces of Don Alvaro de Luna sent
against the Navarrese, the chronicle of the
Constable declares that among his entire host
could hardly have been found a single cavalier
whose horse was not covered with trappings, and
its neck with mail. &ldquo;For some there were that
carried divers figures painted on the aforesaid
trappings, and others that bore upon their helmets
jewels that were a token from their mistresses.
And others carried gold or silver bells suspended
from their horses' necks by thick chains; or
plates upon their helmets studded with precious
stones, or small targes richly garnished with
strange figures and devices. Nor was there less
variety in the crests upon their helmets; for some
bore likenesses of savage beasts, and others
plumes of various colours; while others carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
but a plume or two upon their helmet crest, like
unto those upon the forehead of their horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fifteenth century is often called in Spain
her golden age of arms&mdash;not in the sense that
she invented anything new relating to this craft,
but that her warriors were more fully and more
frequently equipped with what had been imported
from elsewhere. As in the case of crested
helmets, foreign initiative brought about the
substitution of plate or German armour&mdash;developed
from the chain armour and the coat of mail&mdash;for
the earlier sets of disconnected pieces. Possibly,
as a chronicle which describes the Englishmen
and Gascons who were present at the siege of
Lerma in 1334 would seem to indicate, it was in
consequence of this direct association with the
foreigner that the older form of Spanish harness
yielded to the new. However this may be, plate
armour certainly appeared in Spain at some time
in the fourteenth century, and grew in vogue
throughout the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries.
Suits of armour worn by Spanish pikemen and
crossbowmen of this period may be profitably
studied in the Royal Armoury (Plate <a href="#img_202.jpg">xl</a>.); and the
same harness is reproduced in the choir-stalls of
Toledo cathedral, carved by Maestre Rodrigo in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
1495. It is also useful to consult the prolix
description of the <i>Passo Honroso</i> (1433) of Suero
de Quiñones, held at the bridge of Orbigo, as
well as the painting of the battle of La Higueruela
(Plate <a href="#img_206.jpg">xli</a>.) in the Sala de las Batallas of the
Escorial. We find from these authoritative
sources that Spanish harness then consisted of
the war-hat or <i>capacete</i>, with its <i>barbote</i> or piece
to cover the mouth and cheeks, and fringe of
mail (<i>mantillos</i>) to protect the neck: the <i>coracina</i>
or korazin of tinned steel plates;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the coat of
mail; armlets and gauntlets; leg-pieces with
closed greaves; and steel-pointed mail shoes.</p>

</div>

<p>The Spanish man-at-arms of the sixteenth
century is well described by Martin de Eguiluz,
in his book, <i>Milicia, Discursos, y Regla Militar</i>.
&ldquo;The man is mounted and bears a lance. His
head is covered with a visored helmet. He
wears a double breastplate, of which the outer
piece is called <i>volante</i>. His thighs are guarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
by cuisses, his legs by greaves, and his feet by
shoes of mail or iron. His horse's face, neck,
breast, and haunches are covered with iron or
with doubled leather. These coverings are called
<i>bardas</i>, and the horses protected by them <i>bardados</i>,
of which each man-at-arms is called upon to
possess two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These plainer sets of war-harness for horses
were made in Spain. The costlier bards, whether
for war or tournament, were made in Italy and
Germany, and often match the outfit of the rider
in the splendour and luxuriance of their decoration.
Striking examples of these bards are in the
Royal Armoury, including one (Plate <a href="#img_210.jpg">xlii</a>.) which
formerly belonged to Philip the Third. Probably
it is the same referred to in the manuscript
account of Valladolid from which I have already
quoted curious notices of other crafts. Speaking
of the Duke of Lerma in 1605, this narrative
says; &ldquo;He rode a beautiful horse with richly
decorated arms and gold-embroidered bard,
fringed, and with medallions in relief. The
trappings, reaching to the ground, were of black
velvet covered with silver plates as large as
dinner-plates, and others of a smaller size that
represented arms and war-trophies, all of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
gilt, and studded with precious stones. I heard
say that this armour which the Duke now wore,
had once belonged to the Emperor, and is now
the King's.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The crossbow was an arm of great importance
from about the eleventh century until the seventeenth,
and Spain, throughout the latter of these
centuries, was celebrated for their manufacture.
Roquetas, a Catalan, &ldquo;master-maker of crossbows,&rdquo;
constructed them of steel, so skilfully and
finely that they could be carried concealed inside
the sleeve of a coat, and discharged without
awaking the suspicion of the victim. A letter of
René of Anjou, quoted by the Count of Valencia
de Don Juan, also refers to the skill of the
Catalans in making crossbows, and mentions one
of these weapons constructed by &ldquo;Saracen,&rdquo; of
Barcelona, &ldquo;who refuses to teach his craft to
Christians.&rdquo; The letter further states that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
arm was of a curious shape, and that, &ldquo;despite its
small dimensions, it carries to a greater distance
than any other I have yet possessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A handsome Moorish crossbow, inlaid with
bronze (Plate <a href="#img_214.jpg">xliii</a>.), exists in the provincial
museum of Granada. The Royal Armoury has
no example of the rare form of crossbow fitted
with wheeled gear, but all the commoner kinds
employed for hunting or for war are represented
here, including those with the <i>armatoste</i> or
goat's-foot lever, stirruped crossbows, and those
which have the <i>torno</i> or windlass (French <i>cranequin</i>).
Demmin appends the following note to
an illustration in his handbook of a crossbow
with a goat's-foot lever fixed to the stock:&mdash;&ldquo;A
similar weapon in ironwood, sixteenth century,
belonged to Ferdinand the First, proved by the
inscription on the bow: <span class="smcap">Dom Fernando rei de
Romano</span>, followed by four Golden Fleeces. It
bears the name of the Spanish armourer Juan
Deneinas. This valuable crossbow once belonged
to M. Spengel, at Munich, but it is at present in
the collection of the Count of Nieuwerkerke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is also in the Royal Armoury a crossbow
of the scarcer kind known in Spanish as
<i>ballestas de palo</i>, in which the gaffle is not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
steel, but put together from slips of springy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">woods, including yew. The wings are tipped</span><br />
with horn, and traces of heraldic and Renaissance
decoration, painted on parchment, yet remain
upon the weapon. Other portions are inlaid.
Except for the erasure of the painting, this arm
is splendidly preserved, and still retains its double
cord, nut, and pins, together with the separate
lever.</p>

<p>Another interesting crossbow in this armoury
belonged to Charles the Fifth, who used it for
the chase. It has a <i>verja</i> or yard of steel engraved
with the letter C four times repeated and
surmounted by a crown, and bears the inscription,
<span class="smcap">PRO · IMPERATORE · SEMPER · AVGVSTO ·
PLVS · VLTRA ·</span>, together with · <img src="images/img_328.jpg" alt="IV DE LA FVETE" /> ·,
for Juan de la Fuente, the name of a celebrated
maker of these parts of a crossbow. The shaft
(<i>tablero</i>), ornamented in bone and iron, is from
the hand of another master, Juan Hernandez,
whose signature is <span class="smcap">IO: HRZ</span>. The Count of
Valencia de Don Juan supposed that this was
the one crossbow which Charles took with him
to the rustic solitude of Yuste, and which
is mentioned in a document at Simancas as
&ldquo;a crossbow with its gear and gaffles (it is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
His Majesty's possession, but he has not paid
for it).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hitherto I have traced the war-equipment of
the Spanish Christians only. In the early period
of Mohammedan rule, the conquerors used a
simple dress for war, consisting of the <i>capacete</i>
or <i>almofar</i> for the head, secured by a chain
beneath the chin and covered by a piece of
cloth called <i>schasch</i>, hanging to just below the
shoulders; a wide sleeveless tunic; a shirt of
mail; tight breeches, and leather shoes. Their
weapons were the lance and sword. The foot-soldiery
wore the <i>djobba</i>, a tight-sleeved tunic of
white wool, bound to the body by a scarf, and
leather shoes, and carried as their arms a <i>capacete</i>
of beaten iron, without a crest or cheek-pieces;
a large round shield with its projecting umbo;
and either a lance, or a double-edged and double-handed
sword. Such are the details represented
in the <i>Codex of the Apocalypse</i>, preserved in
the cathedral of Gerona. As time progressed,
the weapons and defensive armour of these
Spanish Moors grew more luxurious and ornate,
being often decorated with enamels, precious
stones, or inlaid metals such as silver, gold, and
bronze. Prominent centres of this industry were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Murcia, Zaragoza, and Toledo, which are even
said to have surpassed Damascus. Andalusia,
too, was celebrated for her gold-inlaid cuirasses
and coats of mail; while, according to El Idrisi,
the town of Jativa enjoyed a widespread fame for
every kind of decorative armour.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The military outfit of the Spanish Moors was,
therefore, much the same as that of Christian
Spain. Toledo under Muslim rule continued
to be famous for her swords. Moorish Seville,
Ronda, and Valencia were also favourably known
for weapons, household knives, and scissors.
Cutlery in the Moorish style is still produced in
certain parts of eastern Spain, and in his <i>History
of the Mohammedan Dynasties</i> of this country,
Gayangos tells us of a knife which bore upon one
side of the blade the inscription in Arabic
characters, &ldquo;<i>With the help of God I will inflict
death upon thy adversary</i>,&rdquo; and upon the other
side, in Castilian, the words, &ldquo;<i>Knife-factory of
Antonio Gonzalez. Albacete, 1705.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The primitive Spanish-Moorish sword was an
arm of moderate breadth used both for cutting
and for thrusting. As time went on, this people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
gradually adopted swords of Spanish make or
pattern, such as the ponderous <i>brandimartes</i> and
<i>montantes</i> made for wielding with both hands.
The Granadino writer Aben Said complains
that the adoption of the arms, and even of the
costume of the Spanish Christians, was prevalent
at Granada in the thirteenth century. &ldquo;Sultans
and soldiers alike,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dress in the manner
of the Christians, even to their arms and armour,
crimson cloaks, standards, and saddlery. They
wield in battle a shield and a long lance,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> which
serves them to attack with; nor do they seem
to care for Arab bows or maces, but prefer to
use the Frankish ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the warriors of Granada carried
several weapons which were not of Christian
origin. The tribe of the Beni-Merines brought
across from Africa a kind of sword called often
in the Christian chronicles the <i>espada gineta</i>, used
principally, as we gather from its name, by those
addicted to the Moorish mode of horsemanship,
or riding with short stirrups. The use of it extended
later to the Christian Spaniards, and it
is said to have contributed in later times to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
victory of the Spanish army at Pavia. Other
swords in use among the Granadinos were the
<i>alfange</i>, the <i>chifarra</i>, the <i>chifarote</i>, and the
<i>nammexi</i>. The last of these is described in an
old dictionary of the Valencian and Castilian
languages as a kind of scimitar, although Quatremère
and Fleischer believe it to have been a
dagger.</p>

<p>Another author who describes the arms and
armour of the Granadinos is Al-Jattib, who says
in his <i>Splendour of the New Moon</i>; &ldquo;There are
in Granada two kinds of soldiery&mdash;those of Al-Andalus
and those of Africa. Their leader is a
prince of royal blood, or some exalted personage
at court. Formerly they used the Christian arms;
that is, ample coats of mail, heavy shields, thick
iron helmets, lances with broad points, and
insecure saddles&hellip;. Now they have discarded
that equipment, and are beginning to use short
cuirasses, light helmets, Arab saddles, leather
shields, and thin lances.&rdquo; Of the African troops
the same historian adds; &ldquo;Their weapons for
attacking are spears, either short or long, which
they propel by pressing with the finger. These
arms they call <i>marasas</i>; but for daily exercise
they use the European bow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Descriptions of the Spanish-Moorish swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
inserted in the chronicles and poems of the Middle
Ages, together with the few examples that have
been preserved until our time, enable us to form an
accurate idea of the shape and decoration of these
weapons generally. Those of the sultans and the
Muslim aristocracy were, as a rule, profusely
ornamented, either with precious stones or with
enamels, or else with delicate and lavish damascening,
or with the characteristic Oriental <i>ataujía</i>-work
of gold and silver inlay. Inscriptions, too,
were freely used upon the hilt or scabbard. Thus
we are told that the great Almanzor kept for daily
use a sword which bore the legend; &ldquo;<i>Strive in
warfare till ye win great victories. Battle with
the infidels till ye win them over to Islam</i>&rdquo;; and
similar inscriptions may be quoted in great number.
But four or five of these magnificent arms have
proved superior to the ravages of time, and naturally
tell us more than any weapons whose renown
survives in written records merely. Among such
extant Spanish-Moorish swords are two attributed
respectively to Aliatar and Abindarraez; two
others which are known to have belonged to the
last ill-fated monarch of the Moors of Spain,
Boabdil el Chico; and another, considered to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
also been Boabdil's property, now in possession
of the Marquises of Campotejar, owners of the
Generalife and of the Casa de los Tiros at Granada.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sword of Aliatar,&rdquo; preserved in the
Museum of Artillery at Madrid, is said to have
been wrested from the clenched hand of that
warrior, father-in-law of Boabdil and governor of
Loja, as his corpse was swept away down stream
after the rout of the Moorish expedition at Lucena.
This arm is richly damascened as well as decorated
with the characteristic <i>ataujía</i>. The centre of
the hilt is made of ivory, and the pommel and
crossbars&mdash;which latter terminate in elephants'
heads with slightly upturned trunks&mdash;of damascened
and inlaid iron, ornamented here and
there with <i>ataujía</i>. Part of the blade&mdash;probably
about an eighth&mdash;is broken off. The sheath has
disappeared.</p>

<p>An idle superstition has attributed the so-called
&ldquo;sword of Abindarraez&rdquo; to the hero of the well-known
sixteenth-century romance entitled <i>The
Abencerraje and the Beautiful Jarifa.</i> This
weapon, which for many years was in possession
of the Narvaez family, belongs at present to the
Marquis of La Vega de Armijo. The decoration
is not particularly rich, and part of it is worn away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
but the narrow blade is still engraved with figures
or portraits from the story which has given the
sword its name.</p>

<p>The sword (Pl. <a href="#img_219.jpg">xliv</a>.) belonging to the Marquises
of Campotejar, and which is preserved in the Casa
de los Tiros at Granada, bears some resemblance
to the &ldquo;sword of Aliatar,&rdquo; and has about the same
dimensions. Although it is commonly believed
that Boabdil was the original owner of this sword,
Gómez Moreno considers that more probably it
belonged to one of the Moorish princes of Almería.
The handle and crossbars, as well as the shape
of the sheath, are silver-gilt, covered with minute
arabesque ornamentation forming leaves and
stems, and further decorated with enamel. The
sheath is of Morocco leather worked with silver
thread. The crossbars, curving abruptly down,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
terminate in elephants' trunks boldly upturned towards
the pommel. The blade is stamped with a
Toledo mark consisting of Castilian letters and a
pomegranate.</p>

<p>But the most important, interesting, and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
specimens of Spanish-Moorish arms preserved
to-day are those which were captured from
Boabdil at the battle of Lucena (1482), when the
monarch was made prisoner by the young Alcaide
de los Donceles, Don Diego Fernandez de
Cordova. A manuscript <i>History of the House
of Cordova</i>, quoted by Eguilaz Yanguas,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> says
that upon the day in question, irretrievably disastrous
to the Moorish cause in Spain, Boabdil
carried &ldquo;a short, silver-handled sword, a damascened
dagger, and a lance and buckler of great
strength&rdquo; (Plates <a href="#img_222.jpg">xlv</a>. and <a href="#img_226.jpg">xlvi</a>.). These arms, together
with another and a larger sword (<i>montante</i>
or <i>estoque real</i>) for wielding with both hands, and
certain articles of Boabdil's clothing, continued in
the captor's family for centuries, and were, some
years ago, presented by the Marquises of Villaseca,
his direct descendants, to the National Museum
of Artillery.</p>

</div>

<p>The smaller or <i>gineta</i> sword<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> is handsomer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
more important than the large <i>estoque</i>. The
crossbars, as we find so often in weapons of this
character and date, are bent abruptly down, and
then curve up in a design of dragons' heads&mdash;the
well-known emblem of the Nasrite sultans of
Granada. Part of the handle is of solid gold
adorned with crimson, white, and blue enamel
distributed about the top and bottom of the hilt,
the pommel, and the <i>arriaces</i> or crossbars. The
centre of the hilt consists of ivory, richly carved.
On either side of it are two octagonal intersecting
figures, bearing upon one side, in semi-Cufic
characters, the words, &ldquo;<i>Achieve thy aim</i>,&rdquo; and on
the other, &ldquo;<i>in preserving his</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the owner's)
<i>life</i>.&rdquo; Round the upper border of the ivory is
carved the sentence; &ldquo;<i>In the name of God; the
power belongs to Him, and there is no Divinity but
He. Happiness proceeds from God alone</i>&rdquo;; and
round the lower border, &ldquo;<i>The marvellous belongs
to God. Assuredly at the outset the ignorant do
not know their God; seeing that error is their
custom.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other inscriptions of a sacred character, combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
with delicate <i>ataujía</i>-work, are on the
pommel and the upper portion of the hilt; but
it has been remarked that, although the entire
decoration is amazingly elaborate and rich, these
inscriptions nowhere indicate that the weapon
belonged to a personage of royal blood.</p>

<p>The sheath of this most sumptuous arm is also
lavishly adorned with silver and enamel on a purple
leather ground. The blade is of a later date
than either sheath or hilt, and bears the letter S,
believed to be the mark of Alonso Sahagun the
elder, of Toledo. The total length of this weapon
is thirty-nine inches; and Gayangos declares that
it was worn suspended by a belt between the
shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The large <i>montante</i> which belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
same ill-fated monarch has a cylindrical hilt,
narrower in the centre of the handle than at either
end. This hilt is made of steel inlaid with <i>lacería</i>
or network ornament in ivory. In a small shield
within the decoration of the pommel, appear the
words &ldquo;<i>To God</i>&rdquo;; and in the centre of the
handle, the familiar motto of the Nasrite sultans
of Granada; &ldquo;<i>The only Conqueror is God.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Part of the blade is broken off. That which is
left is broad and straight, with two grooves (one
of which extends about three inches only) on each
side, and bears an oriental mark consisting of
five half-moons. The sheath is of brown Morocco
decorated with a small gilt pattern forming shells
and flowers. The mouth and chape are silver-gilt.</p>

<p>In beautiful and skilful craftsmanship Boabdil's
dagger or <i>gumía</i> matches with his swords. The
handle is of steel inlaid in ivory with floral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
patterns, and terminates in a large sphere,
similarly decorated. The blade has a single edge,
and is exquisitely damascened in gold designs
which cover more than half of all its surface.
Along one side we read the inscription; &ldquo;<i>Health,
permanent glory, lasting felicity, permanent glory,
lasting felicity, and lasting and permanent glory
belong to God</i>&rdquo;; and on the other side, &ldquo;<i>It was
made by Reduan.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sheath of this little arm is made of crimson
velvet richly embroidered with gold thread, and
hanging from it is a large tassel of gold cord and
crimson silk. The chape and mouth are silver-gilt,
profusely decorated, and the latter of these
pieces is embellished with circular devices of a
lightish green enamel, in addition to the chasing.</p>

<p>The small, plain knife, also preserved among the

dagger.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The Royal Armoury at Madrid is often thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
by foreigners<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to contain a representative collection
of the arms, offensive and defensive, used
by the Spanish people through all their mediæval
and post-mediæval history. This is not so.
Although it is the choicest and the richest gallery
in Europe, the Armería Real was formed almost
entirely from the <i>cámaras de armas</i> or private
armouries of Charles the Fifth and of his son, and
is, as Mélida describes it, &ldquo;a splendid gallery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
royal arms,&rdquo; dating, with very few exceptions, from
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The greater part of its contents were made
within a limited interval, as well as not produced
in Spain. Such are the glittering and gorgeous
harnesses constructed for the actual use of Charles
the Fifth by celebrated German and Italian
armourers, ponderous suits for jousting or parade,
or lighter suits for combat in the field, whether
on foot or horseback (Plate <a href="#img_234.jpg">xlviii</a>.), fashioned,
chiselled, and inlaid by craftsmen such as the
Negroli and Piccini of Milan, Bartolommeo
Campi of Pesaro, or Kollman of Augsburg, bombastically
called, by a Spanish poet in the mode
of Gongora, &ldquo;the direct descendant of Vulcanus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This German and Italian armour, with its
multitude of accessorial pieces,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> falls outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
province of a book on Spanish arts and crafts.
Nevertheless, I reproduce, as being too little
known outside Madrid, the sumptuous jousting
harness (Plate <a href="#img_238.jpg">xlix</a>.), of Charles the Fifth, made
for the emperor when he was a lad of only
eighteen years by Kollman Helmschmied of
Augsburg.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Laurent Vital, describing the royal
jousts at Valladolid in 1518, relates that &ldquo;après
marchait le Roy bien gorgiasement monté et
armé d'un fin harnais d'Alemaigne, plus reluisant
que d'argent brunti.&rdquo; This is the very harness
told of by the chronicler. The helmet turns the
scale at forty pounds; the entire suit at two
hundred and fifty-three pounds; and the length
of the lance exceeds eleven feet.</p>

<p>There is, however, also in this armoury a
jousting harness (Plate <a href="#img_242.jpg">l</a>.) formerly the property
of Philip the First of Spain, a part of which,
including the cuirass, is known to be of Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
make. The cuirass in question bears the mark
of a Valencia armourer, and the harness generally
dates from about the year 1500, at which
time Gachard tells us in his <i>Chroniques Belges</i>
that Philip was learning to joust &ldquo;à la mode
d'Espaigne.&rdquo; Besides the enormous helmet and
the Spanish-made cuirass, covered with gold
brocade, this ornament includes a tourneying
lance with a blunt three-pointed head,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and a
curious form of rest, said by the Count of
Valencia de Don Juan to be peculiar to the
Spaniards and Italians. This rest is stuffed with
cork, on which, just as the fray began, the iron
extremity of the lance was firmly driven. Another
interesting detail is the <i>cuja</i>, fastened to
the right side of the cuirass, and also stuffed with
cork, made use of to support the lance upon its
passage over to the rest. Nor in this instance
was the <i>cuja</i> a superfluous device, seeing that
the lance is over fifteen feet in length.</p>

</div>

<p>These are the principal portions of the harness.
The seemingly insufficient protection for the
arms is explained by the fact that the solid wooden
shield completely covered the fighter's left arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
while the right would be defended by the shield-like
disc or <i>arandela</i> of the lance.</p>

<p>Spanish shields and swords of great antiquity
and interest are also in this armoury. The
oldest of the shields dates from the twelfth
century, and proceeds from the monastery of San
Salvador de Oña, Burgos. The material is a
wood resembling cedar, although much eaten by
moth, and is covered on both sides with parchment
bearing traces of primitive painting of a
non-heraldic character. Inside the shield, this
decoration consisted of a black ground crossed
diagonally by a broad red band, and outside, of
a red ground covered with rhomboid figures, some
in gilt and some in colour. Such figures were a
popular pattern at this time and on this class of
objects. The general stoutness of this shield
shows that it was meant for war. It still retains
the strap which slung it from the warrior's neck, as
well as fragments of the braces&mdash;made of buffalo
leather covered with crimson velvet&mdash;for the hand.</p>

<p>Another shield, proceeding from the same
monastery, dates from the thirteenth century.
The material, here again, is wood and parchment;
but in this hundred years formal heraldic ornament
had superseded fancy or conventional devices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Accordingly, this shield is painted with a blazon,
now much worn, of which, however, enough remains
to show that it consisted once upon a time of four
black chaperons crowned with gold <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>
upon a gold ground&mdash;said to have been the arms
of Don Rodrigo Gomez, Count of Bureba.</p>

<p>The <i>scut</i>, or polished metal shield, with painted
blazonry or other decoration, was limited to
Aragon and Cataluña.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Among the smaller and more modern shields
preserved in this collection are two wooden bucklers
dating from the sixteenth century. One is in
the Spanish-Moorish style and of a convex shape,
with iron bordering and umbo, and a lining of
yellow brocade. The other, of the Christian
Spaniards, is small and lined with painted parchment,
and was intended, so the inventory says,
&ldquo;for going about at night.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>There is also a richly gilt and silvered buckler
of the seventeenth century, made at Eugui in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Navarre, and covered with a scene&mdash;decadent in
design and workmanship&mdash;which represents the
judgment of Paris. Defensive armour, chiefly of
a highly decorative kind, was made all through
this century at the capital of Navarre, Pamplona.
The Royal Armoury contains a Pamplonese
parade harness (Plate <a href="#img_250.jpg">lii</a>.), offered as a gift to
Philip the Third, as well as six diminutive sets of
armour made to his order for the youthful princes
Don Felipe, Don Fernando, and Don Carlos.</p>

<p>The <i>adarga</i> was a kind of targe used by the
light cavalry, and had its origin in Africa. Those
which were stored in the palace of the Nasrite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
sultans of Granada are described by Al-Makkari
as &ldquo;solid, without pores, soft to the touch, and
famed for their imperviousness.&rdquo; The material
was strong leather, such as cowhide, often embroidered
with a scutcheon or with arabesques.
Two Spanish-made <i>adargas</i> in this armoury
are particularly handsome. One is of Moorish
craftsmanship, and dates from the end of the
fifteenth century. The other (Plate <a href="#img_254.jpg">liii</a>.), apparently
the work of a Spanish Christian and dating
from a century later, is embroidered in silver
thread and coloured silk with arabesque devices
and also with four coats of arms, one of which
belongs to the noble family of Fernández de
Cordova. The dimensions of this shield are a
yard in height by thirty inches in breadth.</p>

<p>There also are preserved in this collection a
shield (late sixteenth century) adorned by Mexican
Indians with a most elaborate &ldquo;mosaic of feather-work,&rdquo;
and a number of Spanish <i>adargas</i> of the
same period, for playing the <i>juego de cañas</i> or
&ldquo;game of canes.&rdquo; The armoury contained in
former days as many as forty-two <i>adargas</i>; but
the fire of 1884 completely destroyed sixteen and
badly damaged twenty-three, obliterating their
heraldic and other decoration. A yet more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
sinister event befell on December 1st, 1808,
when the Spanish mob, exasperated by the
French, broke in and seized three hundred swords,
not one of which was afterwards recovered.
Mention of these disasters leads me to recall the
quantity of beautiful or historic military gear that
Spain has lost through many tribulations and
vicissitudes. Formerly her noble families had
excellent collections in their palaces or castles.
Such were the private armouries of the Dukes of
Pastrana at Guadalajara, and of the Dukes of
Alburquerque at Cuéllar Castle, near Segovia.
Bertaut de Rouen describes the first as &ldquo;une des
plus belles qui se voyent pour un seigneur
particulier. Il y a quantité d'armes anciennes, et
l'on y void une épée qui s'allonge et s'accourcit
quand on veut, de deux pieds et demy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The
Cuéllar armoury was pulled to pieces by Philip
the Fourth to arm his troops against the French.
&ldquo;Send me,&rdquo; he wrote to the Duke from Madrid,
in a letter dated April 16th, 1637, &ldquo;all your
pistols, carbines, harness for horses, breastplates
and other arms for mounted fighting&rdquo;;
and the loyal nobleman complied upon the spot,
despatching more than five hundred pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
many of which were doubtless of the greatest
interest.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Had I the erudition and the time, I would
attempt to write, as it deserves to be written, an
introduction to the history of Spanish swords.
Of all the objects mentioned in these volumes,
here is the most inherently symbolic of the
Spanish character and history. The Spanish
Moors and Spanish Christians spoke of it as
something superhuman. &ldquo;Once the sword is in
the hand of man,&rdquo; observed, in solemn tones, the
Wise Alfonso, &ldquo;he hath it in his power to raise
or lower it, to strike with it, or to abandon it.&rdquo;
The Spanish Mussulmans talked of putting
&ldquo;clothes and breeches&rdquo; on a sword that had a
sheath, as though it were a breathing person;
while a Spaniard of the time of Gongora would
often use such language as the following: &ldquo;Truly
in point of look there is as great a difference
between a costly sword and a <i>Toledan Loyalty</i> or
<i>Soldier's Dream</i>, as between a marquis and a
muleteer, or a washerwoman and the Infanta.
Yet every sword is virtually an hidalgo. Does
not the basest of our Toledanas, even to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<i>perrillos</i> and <i>morillos</i>, which have no core, and
cost a dozen <i>reales</i> merely, afford a chivalrous
lesson to its wearer, as it bids him <i>no me saques
sin razon, ni me envaines sin honor</i>?<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The
horse and the sword,&rdquo; he continued, taking a
magnificently damascened rapier, and stroking it
caressingly, &ldquo;are the noblest friends of man,
albeit the nobler is the sword; for the horse at
times is obstinate or faint-hearted, but the sword
is ready continually. The sword, moreover,
possesses the chiefest of all virtues&mdash;justice, or
the power of dividing right and wrong; a soul of
iron, which is strength; and, last and greatest,
the Cross, which is the symbol of the blessed
Catholic Faith.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Notices of early Spanish sword-makers are
far from common. Don Manuel G. Simancas
quotes the following, dated in the thirteenth
century:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Master Almerique.</i> By letters of the King
and Queen, to Master Almerique, for making the
(sword) blades for the King; out of the MCC<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
<i>maravedis</i> of his salary he received CCCC
<i>maravedis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Master Enrique.</i> By letters of the King and
Queen, to Master Enrique, for making the swords,
MCCCC, (of which) he received CCCCXII
<i>maravedis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other entries of the same period relate to Juan
Ferrández, armourer, who received a sum for
making coverings for arms and saddles; and to
Master Jacomin, who was paid three gold <i>doblas</i>,
or sixty-three <i>maravedis</i>, for making a breastplate.</p>

<p>In the inventory (1560) of the Dukes of Alburquerque
occurs a very curious notice which seems
to show that mediæval Spanish swords were
manufactured even in the rural districts. The
entry runs; &ldquo;an old grooved sword of a broad
shape, bearing the words <i>Juanes me fezió</i> (&ldquo;John
made me&rdquo;). In the middle of the same a P
within a parted wave, with Portuguese fittings,
varnished, black silk hilt and fringes, and double
straps of black leather, with varnished ends and
buckles and black leather sheath. <i>Juan de
Lobinguez made this sword at Cuéllar.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spanish guilds of armourers enjoyed high
favour,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> since the examination for admission to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
this craft was very strict, as well as fenced
about with curious prohibitions. Thus at Seville,
&ldquo;no Moor, Jew, black man, or other person
such as the law debars, shall set up a shop for
making and selling defensive arms, or undergo
examination in this craft.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The penalty for
infringement of this law was confiscation of the
arms, together with a fine of twenty thousand
<i>maravedis</i>.</p>

<p>Throughout these times the armourer's and the
gilder's crafts are found in closest union; just as
the armourer's craft would often alternate with
that of the goldsmith or the silversmith. At
Seville, the Ordinance of 1512 prescribed that
every candidate who came to be examined must
make &ldquo;a set of horse harness, complete with
stirrups, headstalls, spurs, poitral, and the fittings
of a sword; and he must silver several of these
pieces and blue them with fine blue; and make of
iron, and gild the spurs and fittings of the sword.
Thus shall he make, and gild, and silver the aforesaid
pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Equally severe and comprehensive are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
swordsmiths' Ordinances (1527 to 1531) of
Granada. The aspirant to the title of <i>oficial</i>
&ldquo;shall mount a sword for wear with ordinary
clothes, fitted in black, together with its straps, and
fringed and corded hilt; besides a sword gilded
a low gold, together with its straps and other parts,
all of a single colour. Also he shall fit a velvet-scabbarded,
silver-hilted sword, and a two-handed
sword, fully decorated, with the knife attaching to
the same, one-edged and with a smooth hilt; also
a sword whose scabbard shall be fitted with knives
numbering not less than three; and a hilt of
<i>lacería</i> (network ornament); and another sword
in a white sheath, with woven hilt; and another of
a hand and a half.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The Royal Armoury at Madrid contains an
excellent collection of these weapons. Among
the earliest known to be of Spanish make are
two which date from the thirteenth century. One
of them (Plate <a href="#img_258.jpg">liv</a>., No. 1), with fittings of a
later time, is frequently miscalled the &ldquo;Cid's
Colada,&rdquo; and seems to have been confounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with the genuine weapon of that hero which was
acquired in the thirteenth century by one of the
sovereigns of Castile, and which has probably
disappeared.</p>

<p>The blade of this remarkable sword has two
edges and tapers gradually to the point. Part
of the blade is slightly hollowed, and bears,
extending through about a quarter of the hollow
or <i>canal</i>, the following inscription or device:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_249.jpg" width="400" height="146"
        alt="inscription"

</div>

<p>This is believed by some authorities to
represent the words <span class="smcap">SI, SI, NO, NON</span> (&ldquo;Yes, yes, no,
no&rdquo;); and by others to be a purely meaningless
and decorative pattern. The weapon, in any
case, is in the best of preservation, and is
especially interesting from the fact that engraved
blades dating from this early period are very
seldom met with. The Count of Valencia de
Don Juan believes this weapon to be the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<i>Lobera</i> which belonged to Ferdinand the Third,
and aptly quotes the following passage from the
chronicle. When Ferdinand, conqueror of
Seville, was lying on his death-bed in that
capital, surrounded by his children, he gave his
blessing to his younger son, the Infante Don
Manuel, and addressed him in these words. &ldquo;I
can bequeath no heritage to you; but I bestow
upon you my sword Lobera, that is of passing
worth, and wherewith God has wrought much
good to me.&rdquo; If the Count's surmise be accurate,
another passage which he quotes from the work
<i>Nobleza y Lealtad</i>, written by the twelve
councillors of Ferdinand, fully explains the legend
on the blade. &ldquo;<i>Sennor, el tu si sea asi, e el tu
non, sea non; que muy gran virtud es al Príncipe,
ó á otro qualquier ome ser verdadero, e grand
seguranza de sus vasallos, e de sus cosas.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I said that the chiselled and gilded iron
fittings to the blade are of a later period. They
date from the earlier part of the sixteenth
century, and are the work of Salvador de Avila,
of Toledo.</p>

<p>The other sword in this collection, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
also belongs to the thirteenth century, has a long,
broad blade with two edges and a central groove,
thinly engraved with circles (Pl. <a href="#img_258.jpg">liv</a>., No. 3, and
Pl. lv.). The crossbars are of silver-gilt, engraved
with <i>ataurique</i>, curving towards the blade and
terminating in trefoils. A shield midway between
them bears the arms of Castile upon one side, and
those of León upon the other. The grip is of
wood, covered with silver plates with decorated
borders, and the pommel is of iron, also covered
with ornamental plates of silver-gilt. Formerly
this arm was studded with precious stones, but
all of these excepting one have disappeared.</p>

<p>The scabbard is of wood lined with sheepskin,
and is covered with a series of five silver-gilt
plates, profusely decorated with Hispano-Moresque
<i>lacería</i>, studded with various kinds of gems.
These gems upon the scabbard amounted once
upon a time to seventy-six, which sum, through
pilfering or accident (probably the former, since
the finest stones are gone), has been diminished
by one-half. An inventory, made in the reign
of Philip the Second, states that the inner
side of the sheath, now wholly worn away, was
covered with lions and castles, and that the belt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was of broad orange-coloured cloth, with silver
fittings.</p>

<p>This sword has been absurdly attributed to the
nephew of Charlemagne, who lived not less than
half a thousand years before its date of manufacture.
The Count of Valencia de Don Juan
thought that it may have been the property of a
Spanish monarch of the thirteenth century,&mdash;perhaps
Alfonso the Learned, or Ferdinand the
Third, Alfonso's father. Ferdinand, we know,
possessed a sword which he delivered with due
ceremony to his elder son, the Infante Don
Fernando, upon his leading out a force against
the town of Antequera. This sword the chronicler
Alvar García de Santa María described as
having &ldquo;a sheath in pieces, with many precious
stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of even greater interest than the foregoing
weapon is the great two-handed and two-edged
<i>estoque</i> or ceremonial sword of Ferdinand and
Isabella, which measures forty-two inches in
length. The fittings are of iron, gilded and
engraved. The crossbars, terminating in small
half-moons, with the concave side directed
outward, are inscribed with the well-known motto
of the Catholic sovereigns, <span class="smcap">TANTO MONTA</span>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
with a supplication to the Virgin, <span class="smcap">MEMENTO MEI O
MATER DEI MEI</span>. The pommel is a flat disc,
suggestive in its outline of a Gothic cross, and
bears upon one side the figure of Saint John
together with the yoke, emblem of Ferdinand
the Catholic, and upon the other the sheaf of
arrows, emblem of his consort Isabella. The
hilt is covered with red velvet bound with wire.</p>

<p>The sheath of this most interesting sword&mdash;affirmed
by the Count of Valencia de Don Juan
to have been used by Ferdinand and Isabella, and
subsequently by Charles the Fifth, in the ceremony
of conferring knighthood, and also, during the
Hapsburg monarchy, to have been carried by the
master of the horse before the king upon his
formal visit to a city of his realm&mdash;is made of
wood covered with crimson silk, bearing in
&ldquo;superposed&rdquo; embroidery the arms of Spain
posterior to the conquest of Granada, together
with a repetition of the emblems of the Catholic
sovereigns (Plate <a href="#img_258.jpg">liv</a>., No. 2).</p>

<p>In the same collection are two other swords
which probably belonged to Ferdinand the
Catholic. One of them (Pl. <a href="#img_270.jpg">lvii</a>., No. 1), has a
discoid pommel and a gilded iron handle. The
flat crossbars grow wider and bend down towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the blade, and on the hilt we read the words <span class="smcap">PAZ
COMIGO NVNCA VEO, Y SIEMPRE GVERA DESEO</span>
(&ldquo;Never does peace attend me, and always do
I yearn for war&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This sword has been attributed to Isabella.
The evidence for this belief is slight, although
the Count of Valencia de Don Juan discovered
that in the year 1500 Isabella was undoubtedly
the possessor of certain weapons and armour
which she sometimes actually wore. Among
these objects were several Milanese breastplates,
a small dagger with a gold enamelled hilt in the
shape of her emblem of the sheaf of arrows, and
two swords, one fitted with silver and enamel,
and the other with iron.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>ADARGA</i><br />
(<i>Royal Armoury, Madrid</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The other sword, which probably belonged to
Ferdinand the Catholic, is of the kind known as
&ldquo;of a hand and a half&rdquo; (<i>de mano y media</i>; see
p. 248, <i>note</i>), and also of the class denominated
<i>estoques de arzón</i>, or &ldquo;saddle-bow swords,&rdquo; being
commonly slung from the forepart of the saddle
upon the left side of the rider. Ferdinand, however,
had reason to be chary of this usage, for
Lucio Marineo Sículo affirms that at the siege
of Velez-Málaga the sword which he was wearing
thus suspended, jammed at a critical moment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the fray, and very nearly caused his death.
Sículo adds that after this experience Ferdinand
invariably wore his sword girt round his person,
just as he wears it in the carving on the choir-stalls
of Toledo.</p>

<p>The Royal Armoury contains another sword
improperly attributed both to Ferdinand the
Third and Ferdinand the Catholic. It dates
from the fifteenth century, and has a blade
of unusual strength intended to resist plate
armour. This blade, which has a central ridge
continued to the very point, is very broad towards
the handle, tapers rapidly, and measures
thirty-two inches. At the broader end, and on
a gilded ground embellished with concentric
circles, are graven such legends as:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord is my aid. I will not fear what
man may do to me, and will despise my enemies.
Superior to them, I will destroy them utterly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make me worthy to praise thee, O sweet and
blessed Virgin Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The handle is of iron, with traces of gilded
decoration, and corded with black silk. The
Count of Valencia de Don Juan says that no
reliable information can be found concerning
this fine arm. Its length and general design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
would allow of its being used with one hand or
with both, and either slung from the saddle-bow
or round the middle of a warrior on foot.</p>

<p>Another handsome sword, wrongly attributed
by the ignorant to Alfonso the Sixth, is kept at
Toledo, in the sacristy of the cathedral. The
scabbard is adorned with fourteenth-century
enamel in the <i>champlevé</i> style. Baron de las
Cuatro Torres considers that this sword belonged
to the archbishop Don Pedro Tenorio (see <a href="#Page_269">p. 269</a>),
and adduces his proofs in the <i>Boletín de la
Sociedad Española de Excursiones</i> for March
1897. The prelate in question, appointed to
command an army sent against Granada, was,
like so many of the Spanish mediæval clerics,
of a warlike temper, and &ldquo;exchanged with great
alacrity his rochet for his harness, and his mitre
for his helm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most ridiculous and barefaced
forgeries in the Royal Armoury is a sixteenth-century
sword which has inscribed upon its blade
the name of the redoubtable Bernardo del Carpio.
The Count of Valencia de Don Juan says he
remembers to have met with other blades of
later mediæval make, engraved with such legends
as &ldquo;belonging to Count Fernán-Gonzalez,&rdquo; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
even &ldquo;Recaredus Rex Gothorum,&rdquo; while others
in this armoury are ascribed, without the least
authority of fact or common sense, to García de
Paredes, Alvaro de Sande, and Hernando de
Alarcón. Others, again, with less extravagance,
though not on solid proof, are said to have belonged
to Hernán Cortés, the Count of Lemos,
and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza.</p>

<p>Some, upon the other hand, belonged undoubtedly
to celebrated Spanish warriors of the
olden time. Such are the swords of the Count
of Coruña, of Gonzalo de Córdova, and of the conqueror
of Peru, Francisco Pizarro. The first of
these weapons (Pl. <a href="#img_270.jpg">lvii</a>., No. 4) has a superb hilt
carved in the style of the Spanish Renaissance,
with crossbars curving down, a <i>pas d'âne</i>, and a
Toledo blade of six <i>mesas</i> (&ldquo;tables&rdquo;) or surfaces,
grooved on both sides, and ending in a blunt
point. The armourer's mark, which seems to
represent a <i>fleur-de-lis</i> four times repeated, is
that of the swordsmith Juan Martinez, whose
name we read upon the blade, together with the
words <span class="smcap">IN TE DOMINE SPERAVI</span>, and on the other
side, in Spanish, <span class="smcap">PARA DON BERNARDINO XVAREZ
DE MENDOZA, CONDE DE CORVÑA</span>.</p>

<p>The sword of &ldquo;the great captain,&rdquo; Gonzalo de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Córdova (1453&ndash;1515), is not of Spanish make
(Plate <a href="#img_270.jpg">lvii</a>., No. 3). It has a straight blade with
bevelled edges. The pommel and <i>quillons</i> are
decorated with Renaissance carving, and the
bars, which are of gilded iron, grow wider at
their end and curve towards the blade. The
pommel, of gilded copper, is spherical, and
bears, upon one side, a scene which represents
a battle, together with the words <span class="smcap">GONSALVI
AGIDARI VICTORIA DE GALLIS AD CANNAS</span>. Upon
the other side are carved his arms. Other inscriptions
in Latin are also on the pommel and
the blade.</p>

<p>The Count of Valencia de Don Juan believed
that this sword was a present to Gonzalo from
the corporation of some Italian town, and that it
replaced, as an <i>estoque real</i>, or sword of ceremony,
the state sword (see <a href="#Page_252">p. 252</a>) of Ferdinand and
Isabella.</p>

<p>Pizarro's sword remained in possession of his
descendants, the Marquises of La Conquista, until
as recently as 1809, in which year this family
presented it to a Scotch officer named John
Downie, who had fought in the Peninsular War
against the French. Downie, in turn, bequeathed
it to his brother Charles, lieutenant-colonel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Spanish army, from whom it passed into the hands
of Ferdinand the Seventh. The appearance of
this sword is not remarkable. It has a stout,
four-surfaced blade, with a powerful <i>recazo</i> or
central ridge, engraved with the Christian name
of Mateo Duarte, a swordsmith who was living at
Valencia in the middle of the sixteenth century.
The hilt is of blued (<i>pavonado</i>) steel, inlaid with
leaves and other ornament in gold. The pommel
is a disc; the <i>quillons</i> are straight, or very nearly
so, and there is a <i>pas d'âne</i> (Plate <a href="#img_270.jpg">lvii</a>., No. 2).</p>

<p>The sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries
are famous as the epoch of the Spanish rapier.
Toledo, as the world is well aware, enjoyed an
undisputed name for the production of these
weapons. Within this ancient and historic capital
generations of artists bequeathed, from father to
son, and son to grandson, the secret (if there
were a secret) of the tempering of these matchless
arms; nor have Toledo blades deteriorated to this
day. Many an idle superstition seeks to justify
the talent and dexterity of these swordsmiths;
though probably the key to all their skill was
merely in the manual cunning, based on constant
practice, of the craftsman, as well as in the native
virtues of the water of the Tagus.</p>

<p>In one of my books I have described the workshop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of an armourer of Toledo in the sixteenth
century. &ldquo;After a few moments we entered the
Calle de las Armas, which struck me as having
grown a good deal narrower; and my companion,
pausing beside an open doorway topped with a
sign depicting a halberd and a sword, invited me
to enter. Two or three steps led downwards to
a dark, damp passage, and at the end of this was
a low but very large room, blackened by the
smoke from half a dozen forges. The walls were
hung with a bewildering variety of arms and parts
of armour&mdash;gauntlets and cuirasses; morions,
palettes, and lobster-tails; partisans and ranseurs;
halberds, bayonets, and spontoons; as well as
swords and daggers without number. Several
anvils, with tall, narrow buckets filled with water
standing beside them, were arranged about the
stone-paved floor; and beside each forge was a
large heap of fine, white sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The showers of sparks, together with a couple
of ancient-looking lamps whose flames shook fitfully
to and fro in the vibration, showed thirty or
forty workmen busily engaged; and what with
the clanging of the hammers, the roaring of the
bellows, and the strident hissing of the hot metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
as it plunged into the cold water, the racket was
incessant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cicerone surveyed the discordant scene
with all the nonchalance of lifelong custom,
daintily eluding the columns of scalding steam, or
screening his <i>chambergo</i> from the sparks. Finding,
however, that I was powerless to understand the
remarks he kept addressing to me, he finally held
up his finger and gave the signal to cease work;
upon which the <i>oficial</i> handed him a bundle of
papers which I took to be accounts, and the men,
doffing their leathern aprons, and hanging them
in a corner, filed eagerly away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is quite simple,&rsquo; said my companion, as
though divining the query I was about to put to
him; &lsquo;and indeed, I often wonder why we are so
famous. They say it is the water; but any water
will do. Or else they say it is the sand; and yet
this sand, though clean and pure, is just the same
as any other. Look! The blade of nearly all
our swords is composed of three pieces&mdash;two
strips of steel, from Mondragón in Guipúzcoa,
and an iron core. This latter is the <i>alma</i>, or soul.
The three pieces are heated and beaten together;
and when they grow red-hot and begin to throw
out sparks, they are withdrawn from the fire, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
few handfuls of sand are thrown over them. The
welding of the pieces is then continued on the
anvil; and, finally, the file is brought to bear on
all unevennesses, and the weapon passes on to
the temperer, the grinder, and the burnisher.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is in the tempering that we have earned
our principal renown, although this process is
quite as simple as the rest. Upon the forge&mdash;see,
here is one still burning&mdash;a fire is made in the
form of a narrow trench, long enough to receive
four-fifths of the length of the weapon. As soon
as the metal reaches a certain colour&rsquo; (I thought
I noted a mischievous twinkle in the armourer's
eyes, as though this <i>certain colour</i> were the key
to all our conversation), &lsquo;I take these pincers,
and, grasping the portion which had remained
outside the fire, drop the weapon so, point downwards,
into the bucket of water. Any curve is
then made straight by beating upon the concave
side, and the part which had been previously kept
outside the trench of fire returns to the forge and
is duly heated. The entire blade is next smeared
with mutton fat, and rested against the wall to
cool, point upwards. There is nothing more except
the finishing. Your sword is made.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The following passage from Bowles' <i>Natural</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<i>History of Spain</i>, written in 1752, is also of
especial interest here:&mdash;&ldquo;At a league's distance
from Mondragón is a mine of varnished, or, as
miners term it, frozen iron. It lies in the midst
of soft red earth, and produces natural steel&mdash;a
very curious circumstance, seeing that, as I am
assured, there is no other mine of this description
in the kingdom. A tradition exists that the
iron from this mine was used for making the
swords, so celebrated for their tempering, presented
by Doña Catalina, daughter of the Catholic
Sovereigns, to her husband, Henry the Eighth of
England. A few of these swords are yet extant
in Scotland, where the natives call them <i>André
Ferrara</i>,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and esteem them greatly. The famous
sword-blades of Toledo, and the Perrillo blades
of Zaragoza, which are still so highly valued, as
well as others made elsewhere, are said to have
been forged from the iron of this mine, which
yields forty per cent. of metal. It is, however,
somewhat hard to melt. With a little trouble it
is possible to secure excellent steel, because this
mine, like many another, possesses in itself the
quality of readily taking from the coal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
forge the spirit which is indispensable for making
first-rate swords; but without cementation I do
not think it would serve for making good files
or razors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The swords of which I spoke as being so
famed were generally either of a long shape, for
wearing with a ruff; or broad, and known as the
<i>arzón</i>, for use on horseback. It is probable that
when the ruff was suddenly abandoned at the
beginning of this century, large quantities of
ready-fitted swords began to be imported from
abroad, of such a kind as was demanded by the
novel clothing. This would account for the
decline and the eventual collapse of our factories,
and the loss of our art of tempering swords.
Concerning the mode of executing this, opinions
differ. It is said by some that the blades were
tempered in winter only, and that when they were
withdrawn for the last time from the furnace, the
smiths would shake them in the air at great speed
three times on a very cold day. Others say that
the blades were heated to a cherry-colour, then
plunged for a couple of seconds into a deep
jar filled with oil or grease, and changed forthwith
to another vessel of lukewarm water, after
which they were set to cool in cold water; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
these operations being performed at midwinter.
Others, again, declare that the blades were
forged from the natural iron of Mondragón by
placing a strip of ordinary iron along their core
so as to give them greater elasticity; and
that they were then tempered in the ordinary
manner, though always in the winter. Such
are the prevailing theories about the iron
swords of Mondragón, which are, in truth, of
admirable quality.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Magnificent examples of Toledo sword-blades,
produced while her craft was at the zenith of its
fame&mdash;that is, throughout the sixteenth and the
seventeenth centuries&mdash;are in the Royal Armoury
(Pl. <a href="#img_270.jpg">lvii</a>., Nos. 5, 6, 7). Among them are a series
of <i>montantes</i> made for tournament or war, and a
superb blade, dated 1564, forged for Philip the
Second by Miguel Cantero. The Count of
Valencia de Don Juan considered this to be one
of the finest weapons ever tempered; adding that
the sword-blades of the city of the Tagus were
held in such esteem all over Europe that he had
seen, in numerous museums of the Continent,
weapons professing to be Toledo-made, in which
the blade and mark are evidently forged; bearing,
for instance, <i>Ernantz</i> for Hernandez, <i>Johanos</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
for Juanes, and <i>Tomas Dailae</i> for Tomás de
Ayala.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that the changes in the
national costume, together with the importation
of a lighter make of sword from France, were
directly responsible for the decline of the Toledo
sword-blades early in the eighteenth century.
However, this decline was only temporary.
Townsend wrote in 1786: &ldquo;From the Alcazar
we went to visit the royal manufactory of arms,
with which I was much pleased. The steel is excellent,
and so perfectly tempered, that in thrusting
at a target, the swords will bend like whalebone,
and yet cut through a helmet without turning
their edge. This once famous manufacture
had been neglected, and in a manner lost, but it
is now reviving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laborde endorsed these praises subsequently:
&ldquo;Within a few years the fabrication of swords
has been resumed at Toledo; the place allotted to
this object is a handsome edifice, a quarter of a
league distant from the city, which commands
the banks of the Tagus. This undertaking has
hitherto been prosperous; the swords are celebrated
for the excellence of their blades, which are
of finely tempered steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The modern small-arms factory of Toledo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
situated on the right bank of the Tagus, a mile
from the city walls, had, in fact, been opened in
1783, when the same industry was also reviving
at Vitoria, Barcelona, and elsewhere. Toledo
worthily maintains to-day her ancient and illustrious
reputation for this craft. The Tagus still
supplies its magic water for the tempering, while
part of the prime material of the steel itself
proceeds from Solingen and Styria, and the rest
from Trubia and Malaga.</p>

<p>Cutlery continued to be made in Spain all
through the eighteenth century. Colmenar says
that the knives of Barcelona were considered excellent.
According to Laborde, cutlery was made
at Solsona and Cardona in Cataluña, at Mora
in New Castile, and at Albacete in Murcia.
&ldquo;The cutlery of Solsona is in great repute; but
the largest quantity is made at Albacete. In
the latter place are about twenty-eight working
cutlers, each of whom employs five or six journeymen,
who respectively manufacture annually six
or seven thousand pieces, amounting in the
whole to about one hundred and eighty thousand
pieces.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<h3>FIREARMS</h3>

<p>Cannon of a primitive kind were used in Spain
comparatively early. A large variety of names
was given to these pieces, such as <i>cerbatanas</i>,
<i>ribadoquines</i>, <i>culebrinas</i>, <i>falconetes</i>, <i>pasavolantes</i>,
<i>lombardas</i> or <i>bombardas</i>, and many more; but
the oldest, commonest, and most comprehensive
name of all was <i>trueno</i>, &ldquo;thunder,&rdquo; from the
terrifying noise of the discharge. This word was
used for both the piece and the projectile. The
Count of Clonard quotes Pedro Megía's <i>Silva de
Varias Lecciones</i> to show that gunpowder was
known in Spain as early as the eleventh century.
&ldquo;Thunders&rdquo; of some description seem to have
been used at the siege of Zaragoza in 1118; and
a Moorish author, writing in 1249, describes in
fearsome terms &ldquo;the horrid noise like thunder,
vomiting fire in all directions, destroying everything,
reducing everything to ashes.&rdquo; Al-Jattib,
the historian of Granada, wrote at the beginning
of the fourteenth century that the sultan of that
kingdom used at the siege of Baza &ldquo;a mighty
engine, applying fire thereto, prepared with
naphtha and with balls.&rdquo; The Chronicle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Alfonso the Eleventh describes in a quaint and
graphic passage the crude artillery of that period,
and the panic it occasioned. At the siege of
Algeciras in 1342, &ldquo;the Moors that were within
the city threw many &lsquo;thunders&rsquo; at the (Christian)
host, together with mighty balls of iron, to such a
distance that several overpassed the army, and
some did damage to our host. Also, by means
of &lsquo;thunders&rsquo; they threw arrows exceeding great
and thick, so that it was as much as a man
could do to lift them from the ground. And as
for the iron balls these &lsquo;thunders&rsquo; hurled, men
were exceedingly afraid thereof; for if they
chanced to strike a limb they cut it off as clean as
with a knife, and though the wound were but a
slight one, yet was the man as good as dead; nor
was any chirurgery that might avail him, both
because the balls came burning hot, like flame,
and because the powder which discharged them
was of such a kind that any wound it made was
surely mortal; and such was the violence of these
balls, that they went through a man, together
with all his armour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Towards the close of the same century the
testament of Don Pedro Tenorio (see <a href="#Page_256">p. 256</a>), the
bellicose archbishop of Alcalá de Henares, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
ruled that diocese from 1376 to 1399, contains
the following passage:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Item</i>. We bought
crossbows and bassinets both for foot and horse,
together with shields, pikes, javelins, darts,
lombards, hemp, powder, and other munitions for
the castles of our Church; of which munitions we
stored the greater quantity at Talavera and at
Alcalá de Henares, purposing to deposit them at
Cazorla and in the castles of Canales and of
Alhamin, which we are now repairing after they
were thrown down by the King Don Pedro, and
for the tower of Cazorla, which we are now
erecting. And it is our will that all of these
munitions be for the said castles and tower; and
that no one lay his hand on them, on pain of
excommunication, excepting only the bishop
elected and confirmed who shall succeed us; and
he shall distribute them as he holds best among
the aforesaid castles. And all the best of these
munitions shall be for the governorship of Cazorla,
as being most needed there to overthrow the
enemies of our faith; and we have duly lodged
the shields and crossbows, parted from the rest,
upon the champaign of Toledo; whither should
arrive more shields from Valladolid, that all
together may be carried to Cazorla.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The article from which I quote this passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
adds that the palace of the archbishop at Alcalá
de Henares was fortified with cannon until the
beginning of the nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Cannon are mentioned with increasing frequency
throughout the fifteenth century; and in
the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella we read of
lombards of enormous size, which had to be
dragged across the Andalusian hills and plains
by many scores of men and beasts; which frequently
stuck fast and had to be abandoned on
the march; and which, even in the best of circumstances,
could only be discharged some twice or
thrice a day.</p>

<p>In reading documents and chronicles of older
Spain, it is easy to confound the early forms of
cannon with the engines similar to those employed
by the Crusaders in the Holy Land, and built
for hurling stones or arrows of large size. Such
engines were the <i>trabuco</i>, the <i>almajanech</i> or
<i>almojaneque</i>, the <i>algarrada</i>, and the <i>fundíbalo</i> or
Catalan <i>fonevol</i>. Beuter, in his <i>Chronicle of
Spain and of Valencia</i>, describes the latter as &ldquo;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
certain instrument which has a sling made fast
to an extremity of wood &hellip; made to revolve
so rapidly that the arm, on being released, projects
the stone with such a force as to inflict much
harm, even in distant places, whither could reach
no missile slung by the hand of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning to portable Spanish firearms, we find
that the precursor of the arquebus, musket, and
rifle seems to have been a weapon which was
introduced about the middle of the fifteenth
century, and called the <i>espingarda</i>. Alfonso de
Palencia says it was employed against the rebels
of Toledo in 1467; and the Chronicle of Don
Alvaro de Luna relates that when this nobleman
was standing beside Don Iñigo d'Estúñiga, upon
a certain occasion in 1453, &ldquo;a man came out in
his shirt and set fire to an <i>espingarda</i>, discharging
the shot thereof above the heads of Don
Alvaro and of Iñigo d'Estúñiga, but wounding
an esquire.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">MARKS OF TOLEDAN ARMOURERS (15TH&ndash;17TH CENTURIES),

</div>

<p>As time advanced, portable firearms of first-rate
quality were made throughout the northern
Spanish provinces, and also in Navarra, Cataluña,
Aragon, and Andalusia. The inventory of the
Dukes of Alburquerque mentions, in 1560, &ldquo;four
flint arquebuses of Zaragoza make &hellip; another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
arquebus of Zaragoza, together with its fuse,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;arquebuses of those that are made within this
province&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> of Segovia). Cristóbal Frisleva,
of Ricla in Aragon, and Micerguillo of Seville
were celebrated makers of this arm; but probably
these and all the other Spanish masters of this
craft derived their skill from foreign teaching,
such as that of the brothers Simon and Peter
Marckwart (in Spanish the name is spelt <i>Marcuarte</i>,)
who were brought to Spain by Charles
the Fifth.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The Royal Armoury contains some finely
decorated guns, made for the kings of Spain at
the close of the seventeenth century and early in
the eighteenth, by Juan Belen, Juan Fernandez,
Francisco Baeza y Bis, and Nicolás Bis. The
last-named, pupil of Juan Belen, was a German;
but all these gunsmiths lived and worked at
Madrid. Nicolás was arquebus-maker to Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the Second from 1691, and afterwards held the
same post from Philip the Fifth. He died in
1726, and the Count of Valencia de Don Juan
says that in 1808&mdash;that is, before it was plundered
by the mob&mdash;the Royal Armoury contained no
fewer than fifty-three weapons of his manufacture.
One of the guns which bear his mark, and still
exist, is inscribed with the words, &ldquo;I belong to
the Queen our lady&rdquo; (Isabel Farnese, first wife
of Philip the Fifth), combined with the arms of
León and Castile, and of the Bourbon family.
This weapon was used, or intended to be used,
for hunting.</p>

<p>Diego Esquivel, another gunsmith of Madrid,
was also famous early in the eighteenth century,
as, later on, were Manuel Sutil, José Cano,
Francisco Lopez, Salvador Cenarro, Isidro Soler
(author of a <i>Compendious History of the Arquebus-makers
of Madrid</i>), Juan de Soto, and Sebastián
Santos.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>BRIDONA</i> SADDLE<br />
(<i>15th Century. Royal Armoury, Madrid</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Swinburne wrote from Cataluña in 1775; &ldquo;the
gun-barrels of Barcelona are much esteemed, and
cost from four to twenty guineas, but about five
is the real value; all above is paid for fancy and
ornament; they are made out of the old shoes of
mules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Until 1793, the smaller firearms of the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
army were made at Plasencia in Guipúzcoa. In
that year the government factory, where hand-labour
alone continued to be used till 1855, was
removed to Oviedo. To-day this factory employs
about five hundred workmen. In 1809 Laborde
wrote that &ldquo;firearms, such as fusees, musquets, carbines,
and pistols are manufactured at Helgoivar,
Eybor, and Plasencia; at Oviedo, Barcelona,
Igualada, and at Ripoll; the arms made at the
latter city have long had a distinguished reputation.
Seven hundred and sixty-five gunsmiths,
it is estimated, find employment in the factories of
Guipúzcoa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Townsend and the foregoing writer give
a good account of Spanish cannon at this time.
According to Laborde, &ldquo;two excellent founderies
for brass cannon are royal establishments at
Barcelona and Seville; in the latter city copper
cannon are cast, following the method recommended
by M. Maritz. Iron ordnance are made
at Lierganez and Cavada.&rdquo; Townsend wrote
of Barcelona, in 1786; &ldquo;The foundery for
brass cannon is magnificent, and worthy of
inspection. It is impossible anywhere to see
either finer metal, or work executed in a neater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and more perfect manner. Their method of
boring was, in the present reign, introduced by
Maritz, a Swiss. Near two hundred twenty-four
pounders are finished every year, besides mortars
and field-pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>SADDLERY AND COACHES</h3>

<p>Probably no relic of the former of these crafts
in Spain is older or more curious than the iron
bit (Plate <a href="#img_270.jpg">lvii</a>., No. 8), inlaid with silver
dragons' heads and crosses, and attributed, from
cruciform monograms which also decorate it, to
the Visigothic King Witiza (who died in 711),
or sometimes to the conqueror of Toledo, Alfonso
the Sixth (eleventh century). The spurs or
<i>acicates</i> (Plate <a href="#img_270.jpg">lvii</a>., No. 9) of Ferdinand the
Third of Castile, who conquered Seville from the
Moors, are also treasured in the Royal Armoury,
and bear upon an iron ground remains of gold and
silver decoration representing castles. The Count
of Valencia de Don Juan believed these spurs to
be authentic, because they are identical with the
ones which Ferdinand wears in his equestrian
seal, preserved among the National Archives of
France, and dating from the year 1237.</p>

<p>Saddles of various kinds were used in Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
throughout the Middle Ages. Among them
were the ordinary travelling-saddle or <i>silla de
barda</i> (Arabic <i>al-bardá</i>); saddles <i>de palafrén</i>,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> the
<i>silla de la guisa</i>, or <i>de la brida</i> or <i>bridona</i>, for
riding with long stirrups, and consequently the
antithesis of the <i>gineta</i> saddle;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> or saddles
made for use exclusively in war, on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
rider was accustomed to make the sign of the
cross before or after mounting, such as the <i>lidona</i>,
<i>gallega</i> (&ldquo;<i>siellas gallegas</i>&rdquo; are mentioned in the
<i>Poem of the Cid</i>), and <i>corsera</i> or <i>cocera</i> (Arabic
<i>al-corsi</i>), or else the <i>silla de conteras</i>, &ldquo;whose
hindmost bow,&rdquo; according to the Count of
Valencia de Don Juan, &ldquo;terminated in converging
pieces to protect the wearer's thighs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A saddle known as the <i>silla de rua</i>, or &ldquo;street
saddle,&rdquo; was generally used in Spain throughout
the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries. It
was intended, not for war, but promenade and
show, and therefore richly decorated. The Royal
Armoury has nineteen of these saddles, all of
which are Spanish-made. In the same collection
is a plain <i>bridona</i> saddle (Plate <a href="#img_274.jpg">lix</a>.), with iron
stirrups and two gilt-metal bells, such as were
commonly used in tournaments or other festivals.
This saddle has been erroneously ascribed to the
thirteenth century. It dates from the beginning
of the fifteenth century, and proceeds from
Majorca.</p>

<p class="caption">HANGING <i>JAECES</i> FOR HORSES</p>
</div>

<p>The old belief that one of the saddles in this
armoury, whose bows are chased with a design
in black and gilt of leaves and pilgrim's shells,
was once upon a time the Cid Campeador's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
has been exploded recently. The saddle in
question is known to be Italian, dates from the
sixteenth century, and bears the arms of a town
in the duchy of Montferrato.</p>

<p>The inventory (1560) of the dukes of Alburquerque
mentions some curious saddles, including
one &ldquo;<i>de la brida</i>, of blue velvet, with the bows
painted gold, and on the front bow a cannon with
its carriage, and on the hind bow another cannon
with flames of fire.&rdquo; Among the rest were &ldquo;a
<i>gineta</i> saddle of red leather, used by my lord the
duke,&rdquo; together with saddles of bay leather, of
dark brown leather, of &ldquo;smooth leather with
trappings of blue cloth,&rdquo; of Cordova leather, and
&ldquo;a date-coloured <i>gineta</i>-saddle, complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same inventory specifies innumerable
smaller articles of harness, such as stirrups, spurs,
reins, headstalls, and poitrals or breast-leathers.
Many of these pieces were richly ornamented; <i>e.g.</i>,
&ldquo;some silver headstalls of small size, enamelled
in blue, with gilt supports of iron,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
&ldquo;some silver headstalls, gilded and enamelled
green and rose, with shields upon the temples.&rdquo;
Others of these headstalls were made of copper,
and nearly all were colour-enamelled.</p>

<p>The stirrups included &ldquo;two Moorish stirrups of
gilded tin, for a woman's use&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> &ldquo;some large
Moorish stirrups, gilt, with two silver plates upon
their faces, enamelled gold, green, and blue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
eight nails on either face&rdquo;; &ldquo;some other Moorish
stirrups, wrought inside with <i>ataujía</i>-work in gold,
and outside with plates of copper enamelled in
green, blue, and white; the handles gilt, with
coverings of red leather&rdquo;; and &ldquo;some silver
stirrups with three bars upon the floor thereof,
round-shaped in the manner of an urinal, with
open sides consisting of two bars, a flower within
a small shield on top, and, over this, the small
face of a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The many sets of reins included several of
Granada make, coloured in white, red, and
bay; while one of the most elaborate of the
poitrals was of &ldquo;red leather, embroidered with
gold thread, with fringes of rose-coloured silk,
buckles, ends, and rounded knobs; the whole of
copper enamelled green, and blue, and white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Small but attractive accessories to these handsome
sets of mediæval Spanish harness were the
decorative medals (Plate <a href="#img_278.jpg">lx</a>.) hung from the
horse's breast in tourneying or in war. In France
these medals were known as <i>annelets volants</i>,
<i>branlants</i>, or <i>pendants</i>; although in Spain, where
it is probable that they were used more widely
than in other countries, they have no definite
name. The term <i>jaeces</i> is sometimes applied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
them; but <i>jaez</i> properly means the entire harness
for a horse, and the word is thus employed by
classic Spanish authors, such as Tirso de Molina.
A recent term, invented by a living writer, is
<i>jaeces colgantes</i>, or &ldquo;hanging <i>jaeces</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These ornaments, which had their origin among
the Romans and Byzantines, are figured in certain
of the older Spanish codices such as the <i>Cántigas
de Santa Maria</i>. In Christian Spain, however,
their vogue was greatest in the thirteenth and
the fourteenth centuries. They disappeared altogether
in the sixteenth century; and among the
Spanish Moors their use, though not unknown,
was always quite exceptional.</p>

<p>The mottoes and devices on these little plates
are very varied. Sometimes the motto has an
amorous, sometimes a religious import. Sometimes
the vehicle of the motto is Latin, sometimes
Spanish, sometimes French. Sometimes
the device contains, or is composed of, a blazon,
and commonly there is floral or other ornament.
A collection of nearly three hundred of these
medals belonged to the late Count of Valencia
de Don Juan, all of which were probably made
in Spain. The material as a rule is copper,
adorned with <i>champlevé</i> enamelling, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
colours often used to decorate and relieve the
interspaces of the gilded metal are red, blue,
black, white, and green.</p>

<p class="caption">TRAVELLING LITTER<br />
(<i>Attributed to Charles the Fifth. Royal Armoury, Madrid</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>According to Florencio Janer, coaches were
not known in Spain until the middle of the sixteenth
century. Before that time the usual conveyance
was the litter. The Madrid Armoury
contains an object which is thought to have been
the campaigning-litter of Charles the Fifth
(Plate <a href="#img_282.jpg">lxi</a>.). The Count of Valencia de Don
Juan also inclined to this belief from the circumstance
that an engraving exists in the British
Museum which represents a German litter of the
sixteenth century, identical in all respects with
this one. Probably, however, these litters were
the same all over Europe. The inventory of the
Dukes of Alburquerque includes, in 1560, a &ldquo;cowhide
litter, black, lined with black serge; also
poles stained black, and harness for mules.&rdquo;
This, together with other travelling gear, belonged
to &ldquo;my lady the duchess&rdquo;; and it is
worth noting that the litter attributed to Charles,
though cased with a protective covering of
whitish canvas, is also of black leather and lined
with black serge, besides being evidently built for
carriage by two mules. The interior contains a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
small armchair rising some inches only from the
floor, and which, requiring him to keep his legs
continually outstretched, could hardly fail to prove
excruciatingly uncomfortable to the traveller.</p>

<p>Mendez Silva says that the precise date of the
introduction of coaches into Spain was 1546,
and other writers do not greatly differ from him.
The Alburquerque inventory includes &ldquo;two four-wheeled
coaches,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;a triumphal car
with four wheels, its body painted with red and
gold stripes.&rdquo; Vanderhamen, who says that the
first coach ever seen in Spain was brought here
by a servant of Charles the Fifth in 1554, adds
that within a little time their use became &ldquo;a hellish
vice that wrought incalculable havoc to Castile.&rdquo;
Certainly this vehicle for many years was far from
popular among the Spaniards, and was assailed
with special vehemence by all who lacked the
income to support one. The Duke of Berganza
is said to have remarked that &ldquo;God had fashioned
horses for the use of men, and men had fashioned
coaches for the use of women&rdquo;; while a priest,
Tomás Ramón, declared that it was &ldquo;a vast
disgrace to see bearded men, with rapiers at their
side, promenading in a coach.&rdquo; Even the governing
powers thought fit to interfere. In 1550,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
1563, and 1573 the Cortes demanded the total
prohibition of these modish yet detested vehicles,
while the Cortes of 1578 decreed four horses as
the statutory and invariable number for a private
carriage. A further law enacted in 1611 that
coaches must be strictly private property, and not,
on pain of rigorous chastisement, be lent or hired
by their owner;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> while the owner, to own or use
a coach at all, required a special licence from the
Crown.</p>

<p>Some curious facts relating to these vehicles in
older Spain are instanced by Janer. In the
seventeenth century a Spanish provincial town
would normally contain a couple of hundred
coaches. Among such boroughs was Granada.
Here, in 1615, the authorities, backed by
nearly all the citizens, protested that the coaches
ploughed the highway into muddy pits and
channels, and gave occasion, after nightfall, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
disgraceful and immoral scenes.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> After a while
the protest grew so loud that the use of coaches in
this capital was totally suppressed. One of the
first persons to employ a coach in Granada had
been the Marquis of Mondejar; and yet, in spite
of his extensive influence, this nobleman, each
time he wished to drive abroad, required to
sue for licence from the town authorities, and
these, in making out the written permit, took
care to specify the streets through which he was
allowed to pass.</p>

<p>Assailed by numerous pragmatics,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> chiefly of a
sumptuary tenor and repeated at spasmodic
intervals until as late as 1785, the private coach
became at last an undisputed adjunct to the
national life of Spain. Doubtless the use by
royalty of gala-coaches or <i>carrozas</i> went far to
sanction and extend their vogue. However, I
will not describe these lumbering, uncouth, and
over-ornamented gala-carriages (some of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
were made in Spain) belonging to the Spanish
Crown, but quote the following pragmatic, dated
1723, as aptly illustrative of the progress of this
industry, and other industries akin to it, in the
Peninsula:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to restrain the immoderate use of
coaches, state-coaches, <i>estufas</i>, litters, <i>furlones</i>,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
and calashes, we order that from this time forth
no one of these be decorated with gold embroidery
or any kind of silk containing gold, nor yet with
bands or fringes that have gold or silver points;
but only with velvets, damasks, and other simple
silken fabrics made within this realm and its dependencies,
or else in foreign countries that have
friendly commerce with us. Also, the fringes
and galloons shall be of silk alone; and none, of
whatsoever dignity and degree, shall cause his
coach, state-coach, etc., to be decorated with the
fringes that are known as net-work, tassel-pointed,
or bell-pointed; but only with undecorated, simple
fringes, or with those of Santa Isabel; nor shall
the breadth of either kind of these exceed four
fingers. Also, he shall not cause his coach, state-coach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
etc., to be overlaid with any gilt or silvered
work, or painted with any manner of design&mdash;meaning
by such, historic scenes, marines, landscapes,
flowers, masks, knots of the pattern known
as coulicoles, coats of arms, war devices, perspectives,
or any other painting, except it imitate
marble, or be marbled over of one single colour
chosen at the owner's fancy; and further, we
allow in every coach, state-coach, etc., only a
certain moderate quantity of carving. And this
our order and pragmatic shall begin to rule upon
the day it is made public; from which day forth
no person shall construct, or buy, or bring from
other countries, coaches or <i>estufas</i> that infringe
our law herein expressed; wherefore we order
the <i>alcaldes</i> of this town, our court and capital, to
make a register of all such vehicles that each
house contains, without excepting any. Nevertheless,
considering that if we should prohibit
very shortly those conveyances that now be
lawful, the owners would be put to great expense,
we grant a period of two years wherein
they may consume or rid themselves thereof;
upon the expiration of which term our law
shall be again made public, and thenceforward
all, regardless of their quality and rank, shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
compelled to pay obedience to the same. Also
we order that no person make or go abroad in
hand-chairs fitted with brocade, or cloth of gold
or silver, or yet with any silk containing gold and
silver; nor shall the lining be embroidered or
adorned with any of the stuffs aforesaid; but
the covering of the chair, inside and out, shall
only be of velvet, damask, or other unmixed silk,
with a plain fringe of four fingers' breadth and
button-holes of the same silk, and not of silver,
gold, or thread, or any covering other than those
aforesaid; but the columns of such chairs may be
adorned with silken trimmings nailed thereto.
And we allow, as in the case of coaches, a period
of two years for wearing out the hand-chairs now
in use&hellip;. Also, we order that the coverings
of coaches, <i>estufas</i>, litters, calashes, and <i>furlones</i>
shall not be made of any kind of silk, or yet the
harness of horses or mules for coaches and travelling
litters; and that the said coaches, gala-coaches,
<i>estufas</i>, litters, calashes, and <i>furlones</i> shall not be
back-stitched (<i>pespuntados</i>), even if they should
be of cowhide or of cordwain (goatskin); nor shall
they contain any fitting of embroidered leather.&rdquo;</p>

of Spain and Portugal have been investigated by many scientists,

discovered numbers of these weapons. Towards the middle of

compiled in 1560, of the Dukes of Alburquerque. One is
particularly interesting. It is described as &ldquo;a Moorish <i>gineta</i>
sword which belongs to the Count of Monteagudo, and is pawned for
six thousand <i>maravedis</i>. The sheath is of bay leather, worked in
gold thread. The chape and fittings are of silver, decorated with
green, blue, purple, and white enamel. There are two serpents'
heads upon the fitting, together with the figure of a monster
worked in gold thread on a little plate, and two large scarlet
tassels: the little plate has three ends of the same enamel and a
silver-gilt buckle.&rdquo; A note at the margin adds; &ldquo;The chape is
wanting, and is owed us by the Marquis of Comares, who lost it at
the cane-play at Madrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two serpents' heads formed part of the arms of the Alahmar
sultans of Granada; so that from this and from the richness of this
weapon we may infer that it had once belonged to Mussulman
royalty. The same inventory describes &ldquo;a Moorish scimitar with
gilded hilt; the cross and pommel, and a great part of the scimitar
itself, being of gilded <i>ataujía</i> work. The sheath is green inside, and
black and gilt upon the face; and hanging from the hilt is a gold
and purple cord with a button and a black tassel.&rdquo;</p></div>

as &ldquo;an epitome of Spanish history.&rdquo; Swinburne's notice of the
same armoury is also curious: &ldquo;At the bottom of the palace-yard
is an old building, called the Armeria, containing a curious assortment
of antique arms and weapons, kept in a manner that would have
made poor Cornelius Scriblerus swoon at every step; no notable
housemaid in England has her fire-grates half so bright as these
coats of mail; they show those of all the heroes that dignify the
annals of Spain; those of Saint Ferdinand, Ferdinand the Catholic,
his wife Isabella, Charles the Fifth, the great Captain Gonsalo, the
king of Granada, and many others. Some suits are embossed with
great nicety. The temper of the sword blades is quite wonderful,
for you may lap them round your waist like a girdle. The art of
tempering steel in Toledo was lost about seventy years ago, and the
project of reviving and encouraging it is one of the favourite schemes
of Charles the Third, who has erected proper works for it on the
banks of the Tagus.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> Throughout this time, the full equipment of the knight consisted
of no less than four complete suits, for tournament or battle,
or for foot or mounted fighting, together with their lances, swords,
and targes. The Alburquerque inventory describes in detail a
complete set (&ldquo;all of it kept in a box&rdquo;) of war and tourneying
harness belonging to the duke. Although the warriors of that day
were short of stature, their muscular strength is undeniable, for
one of their lances has to be lifted nowadays by several men.
When the author of <i>Mogreb-El-Acksa</i> wrote contemptuously of the
&ldquo;scrofulous champions tapping on each other's shields,&rdquo; he was
perhaps, forgetful for a moment of this fact.</p></div>

at Simancas, that in the year 1525 Kollman visited Toledo to
measure Charles for armour. It is also certain, adds the Count,
that, in order to produce this armour of a perfect fit, Kollman first
moulded Charles' limbs in wax, and then transferred the moulds to
lead. In a budget of accounts which coincides with Kollman's
visit to Toledo appears the following item: &ldquo;Pour trois livres de
cire et de plomb pour faire les patrons que maître Colman,
armoyeur, a fait&rdquo;&mdash;followed by details of the cost.</p></div>

<p>The arms of Spaniards promenading after dark were even fixed
by law. The <i>Suma de Leyes</i> of 1628 ordains that after ten o'clock
nobody is to carry arms at all unless he also bears a lighted torch
or lantern. No arquebus, on pain of a fine of ten thousand
<i>maravedis</i>, may have a barrel less than a yard long. Nobody may
carry a sword or rapier the length of whose blade exceeds a yard
and a quarter, or wear a dagger unless a sword accompanies it.
Sometimes these prohibitions extended even to seasons of the
year. In 1530 an Ordinance of Granada proclaims that from
the first of March until the last day of November nobody may
carry a hatchet, sickle, or dagger, &ldquo;except the dagger which is
called a <i>barazano</i>, of a palm in length, even if the wearer be a
shepherd.&rdquo; The penalty for infringement of this law was a fine of
ten thousand <i>maravedis</i>; but labourers who worked upon a farm
were exempted from the prohibition.</p>

<p>Swinburne wrote from Cataluña, in 1775, that &ldquo;amongst other
restrictions, the use of slouched hats, white shoes, and large brown
cloaks is forbidden. Until of late they durst not carry any kind of
knife; but in each public house there was one chained to the table,
for the use of all comers.&rdquo;</p></div>

&lsquo;Ginete en ambas sillas,&rsquo; that is, accustomed to either saddle, <i>i.e.</i>
the Moorish and the Christian, and I now understand why
chroniclers have taken the trouble to record the fact. Strangely
enough, the high-peaked and short-stirruped saddle does not cross
the Nile, the Arabs of Arabia riding rather flat saddles with an
ordinary length of leg. The Arab saddle of Morocco, in itself, is
perhaps the worst that man has yet designed; but, curiously enough,
from it was made the Mexican saddle, perhaps the most useful for
all kinds of horses and of countries that the world has seen.&rdquo;
Cunninghame Graham: <i>Mogreb-El-Acksa</i>, p. 66. The same
writer naïvely adds the following footnote to the words <i>Ginete en
ambas sillas</i>. &ldquo;This phrase often occurs in Spanish chronicles,
after a long description of a man's virtues, his charity, love of the
church, and kindness to the poor, and it is apparently inserted as
at least as important a statement as any of the others. In point
of fact, chronicles being written for posterity, it is the most
important.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_145_145" id="Footnote_145_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145_145"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> As I have stated in another chapter, the precious stones
and metals were continually employed in arms and harness,
both of Spanish Moors and Spanish Christians. In 1062
Pedro Ruderiz bequeathed to the Monastery of Arlanza all his
battle harness, together with his silver bit (<i>frenum argenteum</i>).
Thousands of such bequests have been recorded. The
Chronicle of Alfonso the Eleventh says that after the victory
of the Rio Salado, this monarch found among his spoil &ldquo;many
swords with gold and silver fittings, and many spurs, all of
enamelled gold and silver&hellip;. And all this spoil was gathered
by the king into his palaces of Seville (<i>i.e.</i> the Alcázar), the
doubloons in one part, and the swords in another part.&rdquo; The
testament (sometimes considered to be a forgery) of Pedro the
Cruel mentions &ldquo;my sword in the Castilian manner, that I
caused to be made here in Seville with gems and with <i>aljofar</i>.&rdquo; In
1409 Yusuf, King of Granada, presented Juan the Second and the
Infante Don Enrique with silver-fitted swords. Referring to a
later age, Davillier discovered at Simancas a detailed list of weapons
sumptuously decorated with gold and coloured enamels, made for
Philip the Second by Juan de Soto, &ldquo;<i>orfebrero de su Alteza</i>.&rdquo;

riding. Another&mdash;though owing to the temperate climate it must have
been on few occasions&mdash;was skating, since this inventory mentions
&ldquo;two pairs of skates, for a man, for travelling over ice. Two pairs
of skates, for the same purpose, for a woman.&rdquo; This entry almost
matches in its quaintness with the &ldquo;irons for mustaches,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;triggers for extracting teeth,&rdquo; set forth in Spanish documents such
as the <i>Tassa General</i> of 1627.</p></div>

the end of the eighteenth century; &ldquo;Having occasion one day
for a coach to carry us about, the stable-boy of our inn offered his
services, and in a quarter of an hour brought to the door a coach
and four fine mules, with two postillions and a lacquey, all in
flaming liveries; we found they belonged to a countess, who, like
the rest of the nobility, allows her coachman to let out her equipage
when she has no occasion for it; it cost us about nine shillings,
which no doubt was the perquisite of the servants.&rdquo;</p></div>
